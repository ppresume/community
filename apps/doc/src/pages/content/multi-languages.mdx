# Multi Languages

PPResume aims to be the kind of resume builder that supports multi languages out
of the box.

Technically, there are two categories of things to do when supporting multi
languages:

- **[Internationalization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-internationalization-i18n)**:
  often abbreviated as "i18n" (where the number 18 represents the 18 characters
  between "i" and "n"), is basically a set of practices that allow a product
  support multi languages, i18n main consists of translating the product into
  mutli languages and dynamically switching the language according to the user's
  choice
- **[Localization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-localization-l10n)**:
  often abbreviated as "l10n" (the number 10 represents the characters between
  "l" and "n"), it goes beyond mere translation and instead adapts the product
  to the cultural specifics of the target language.

In practice, i18n always comes first, l10n comes after.

For all languages that we have supported, we have the following concerns from a
design and implementation perspective:

- **[Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)**: the theorectical
  side of a language, including but not limited to the language's character set,
  syntax and grammar, history, etc.
- **Idioms**: common conventions and idioms that are generally followed by a
  language.
- **[Typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting)**: best typesetting
  practices often followed by a language, such as italics, text figures, font
  style, kerning, ligature, etc.
- **Translations**: mere translations for a fixed set of terms and
  options used by resumes generated by PPResume.

## Glossaries

We have used the following glossaries throughout this section:

- **Latin script languages**: languages that use
  [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script) as the [writing
  systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system). Most [germanic
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), [romance
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) and many other
  languages like
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language)
  use Latin script as the primary writing system.
- **[CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters)**: Chinese, Japanese and
  Korean languages.
- **[Character Set](https://www.creatopy.com/blog/what-is-a-character-set/)**:
  the complete collection of characters, symbols, glyphs, and punctuation marks
  available within a specific typeface or font.
- **[Glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph)**: the specific shape, design,
  or representation of a character in typography.
- **[Hyphenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabification)**, the practice
  of breaking words at the end of lines to improve the overall appearance and
  readability of text.
- **[Justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_alignment#Justified)**:
  the alignment of text within a block so that it is flush with both the left
  and right margins, generally achieved by adjusting the spacing between words
  and letters, creating a uniform appearance across each line of text.
- **[Kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning)**: the process of adjusting
  the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a
  visually pleasing result.
- **[Ligature](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)>)**: a glyph
  that joins two or more letters together in order to enhance the visual appeal
  of text and get better readability.
