# English

As we all know, English is widely used and spoken all over the world.

Supporting English in PPResume is much easier than supporting other languages,
there's very little extra setup to do in order to support English resumes with
LaTeX.

## Linguistics

Theoretically, English belongs to [Germanic
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), which is a branch
of the [Indo-European language
family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) spoken natively
by a population of about 515 million people mainly in Europe, North
America, Oceania, and Southern Africa.

### Character Set

Modern English is written with a Latin alphabet consisting of 26 letters, with
each having both uppercase and lowercase forms.

[Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) is the most
widely used alphabetic writing system in the world.

## Idioms

### Date

English has dedicated words for months, while each has a short form. PPResume
adopts the short form for all month fields by default.

| Long Form | Short Form |
| --------- | ---------- |
| January   | Jan        |
| February  | Feb        |
| March     | Mar        |
| April     | Apr        |
| May       | May        |
| June      | Jun        |
| July      | Jul        |
| August    | Aug        |
| September | Sep        |
| October   | Oct        |
| November  | Nov        |
| December  | Dec        |

### Location

Different languages present locations in different format. In English, when
presenting a location with address, city, and country, the general part
(country, state, etc.) typically comes last, while the most specific part (town,
address, etc.) comes first. In some other languages like Chinese, the order is
totally reversed.

Here's the typical order in English:

1. Address: This includes the street number, street name, apartment number, etc.
2. City: The name of the city or town.
3. State/Province: The state or province, if applicable.
4. Country: The name of the country.

## Typesetting

languages, English is no exception here. We have already prepared a
[guide](/guide) which covers lots of details.
