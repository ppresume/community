# Output Format

PPResume is a LaTeX-based resume builder, that being said, we adopt
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) as [the typesetting
engine](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/on-typesetting-engines).

By default, PPResume provides PDF files as the output format for your resumes.
However, we also provide the LaTeX source code for your resumes, so in case that
one day you do not like us anymore, you can always re-create the resume PDF with
the LaTeX source code yourself. **We believe that users should have 100% control
over their data** and we do not want to lock users into our platform by not
providing the LaTeX source code and forbidding them to re-create their own
resumes.

**No vendor lock-in**. LaTeX is a free and open-source typesetting system, and
the code generated by PPResume is not and should not be what we a profit on.

For now we support two output formats:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card title="PDF" href="/content/output-format/pdf" />
  <Cards.Card title="Code" href="/content/output-format/code" />
</Cards>
