## Why PDF?

[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (Portable Document Format) is widely
recognized for its ability to preserve document formatting across different
devices and platforms. This makes it an ideal choice for resumes, ensuring that
your carefully crafted document looks the same whether viewed on a computer,
tablet, or smartphone.

However, PDF is not perfect, it has its own drawbacksâ€”one of the most
painful ones is that PDF is generally not editable. If you want to edit the PDF
files, you need to use a PDF editor and most of the professional PDF editors are
not free.

That's why PPResume also provides the [LaTeX source code](./code) for your
resumes, so that you don't feel helpless if you need to edit or re-create your
resumes.
