# Code

PPResume provides the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for
your resumes right out of the box. If you want to dive in and re-create your
resumes from scratch, you can copy and save the code somewhere and generate the
PDF by yourself.

![PPResume Output Code](/static/images/output-format/ppresume-output-code.webp)

There are generally two ways to generate the PDF from the LaTeX source code:

1. Overleaf
2. Local LaTeX Environment

## Overleaf

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a cloud-based LaTeX editor that allows
you to write, compile, and preview LaTeX documents online. It provides a free
forever plan for you to get started with LaTeX.

We strongly recommend that you use overleaf to compile the LaTeX source code,
as this is the easiest way to get started. Installing and configuring the
LaTeX environment on your local machine is a non-trivial job and requires a
lot of time.

## Local LaTeX environment

If you want 100% control over the code and the resumes, you can set up a LaTeX
environment on your local machine. We will guide you through the process of
setting up a LaTeX environment on different operating systems, installing the
necessary fonts, and the steps to compile a `.tex` file to a PDF using XeLaTeX.

### 1. Install TeX Live

[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is a comprehensive TeX system that you
can install on various operating systems. You can follow the
[manual](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-140003)
to install TeX Live on your system. Or you can follow the short instructions
below to install TeX Live on your system.

#### Windows

1. Download the TeX Live installer from the [official TeX Users Group
   website](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to perform a full
   installation.

#### macOS

1. Download and install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/), which is the macOS
   distribution of TeX Live.
2. Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install MacTeX by
   running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
brew install --cask mactex
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install TeX Live using the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### 2. Install necessary fonts

Under the hood, PPResume adopts the [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) engine to
compile the LaTeX source code to PDF. XeLaTeX is a LaTeX engine that uses
Unicode to support a wide range of fonts, including CJK (Chinese, Japanese,
Korean) fonts.

At the time of writing, PPResume uses the following fonts:

- [Linux Libertine](https://www.linuxlibertine.org/)
- [Noto CJK](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk)

You need to install the fonts on your system before you can compile the LaTeX
source code generated by PPResume.

Different fonts have different ways to install on different operating systems,
you are on your own to install and
[configure](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/XeLaTeX) the fonts in the right
way.

### 3. Compile a TeX file to PDF

Once you have TeX Live and necessary fonts installed, you are ready to compile
PPResume generated `.tex` files to PDF using XeLaTeX. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a `.tex` file with the generated LaTeX source code from PPResume:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, serif, 11pt]{moderncv}

%% moderncv
% style and color
\moderncvstyle{banking}
\moderncvcolor{black}

% needed by moderncv for showing icons
\usepackage{fontawesome5}

%% page layout/margins
\usepackage[top=2.5cm, bottom=2.5cm, left=1.5cm, right=1.5cm]{geometry}

%% CTeX
% CJK support, used to show CJK characters in the resume
%
% - fontset=none: disable builtin fontset but instead set the CJK font manually
% - heading=false: disable ctex heading
% - punct=kaiming: use kaiming punctuations styles for CJK
% - scheme=plain: use plain scheme, do not override `\normalsize` font size
% - space=auto: space settings for CJK characters
%
% ref:
% - http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/language/chinese/ctex/ctex.pdf
\usepackage[UTF8, fontset=none, heading=false, punct=kaiming, scheme=plain, space=auto]{ctex}
\setCJKmainfont{Noto Serif CJK SC}
\setCJKsansfont{Noto Sans CJK SC}

%% fontspec
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont[Ligatures={TeX, Common}, Numbers=OldStyle]{Linux Libertine O}

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where your `.tex` file is located.
4. Run the following command to compile the `.tex` file to a PDF using XeLaTeX:

```sh
xelatex your-resume.tex
```

This will generate a PDF file named `your-resume.pdf` in the same directory.
