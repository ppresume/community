The resume is your face.

In a piece of A4, 210mm \* 297mm, a resume ends the previous stage of
life and starts the next one.

"A nine-storey tower arises from a pile of earth."(_Laozi_, chapter 64)
Likewise, a pretty-print resume is based on details of font, punctuation, layout
and grammar.

This guide will systematically explain the essentials of resume writing and
typesetting with particular emphasis on typography, helping you make a resume
pretty both in form and spirit. For each topic, we will first explain WHAT it
is, then WHY it is so, and finally HOW to do it.

The guide is trying to be as concise and clear as possible, for different
declarations there are four levels of priorities:

- MUST, mandatory in typesetting, serious mistake if violated
- RECOMMEND, conform to general typesetting standards, highly recommended
- SHOULD NOT, require advanced knowledge or features in typesetting, or diverse
  in different languages and cultures, or vary with regulations in companies,
  dangerous to use if not informed
- MUST NOT, conflict with general typesetting standards, forbidden to apply
