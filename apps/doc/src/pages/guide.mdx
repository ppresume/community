A pretty-print resume is based on details such as font, punctuation, layout
and grammar.

This guide systematically explains the essentials of resume writing and
typesetting with special emphasis on typography, helping you to make a resume
beautiful in form and spirit. For each topic, it first explains WHAT it is, then
WHY it is so, and finally HOW to do it.

The guide tries to be as concise and clear as possible, there are four priority
levels for the different explanations:

- **MUST**, mandatory in typesetting, serious mistake if violated
- **RECOMMEND**, conform to general typesetting standards, highly recommended
- **SHOULD NOT**, require advanced knowledge or features in typesetting, or diverse
  in different languages and cultures, or vary with regulations in companies,
  dangerous to use if not informed
- **MUST NOT**, conflict with general typesetting standards, forbidden to apply
