## File format

Common file formats for resumes include:

- PDF
- Microsoft Word (doc, docx)
- Plain Text
- HTML

Here we recommend PDF most:

- PDF has quite excellent quality of output across platforms, and can guarantee
  almost 100% consistent printing and display effects
- fonts can be embedded in PDF, so it's quite free to choose fonts
- on most platforms there is a default PDF reader
  - Windows 8 and above have a built-in PDF reader
  - Mac OS X has
    [Preview](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(Mac_OS)>), iOS
    has [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibooks/)
  - many browsers (such as Chrome) have built-in
    [pdf.js](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), which can also open PDF by default

It's easier to learn MS Word, but delivering a resume with Word format has great
disadvantages:

- Word documents must be opened with additional office software
  installed
  - Microsoft Word, [WPS Office](https://wps.com) for Windows
  - [iWork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork) for Mac OS X
  - [WPS Office](https://wps.com), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
    for Linux
  - many online document editing systems such as [Google
    Docs](https://docs.google.com/) can also open and edit Word documents
- Word documents may display quite differently in different software on
  different platforms
  - in reality not everyone has installed [Microsoft
    Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word) on his computer
  - another fact is that a genuine license for Microsoft Word will cost hundreds
    of dollars
- in order to ensure consistent display and output effects, it's best to use
  only a few shared fonts on mainstream operating systems in Word documents, which
  greatly limits the freedom of fonts selection

Of course, different HR managers in various companies can have different
requirements and preferences. We recommend that you export the resume to PDF as
an alternative if making it by Word

## Email etiquette

Besides unique recruitment systems of companies, emails are the main approach
for candidates to deliver resumes. The basics of email etiquette are as follows:

- set up correct mailbox nicknames, do not use informal nicknames that are too
  fancy, which will make a very unprofessional impression on the employers
- use a uniform format in the email header, keep it clear and concise to convey
  the most important information
  - recommended format: Apply-Company
    Position-Name-\[University/Education\]-\[Work Experience\]
- keep the email text concise, it's not recommended to write a too long
  application letter that is very emotional or contains too much personal
  subjective evaluation
  - best to add the title and a greeting at the beginning of text
  - contents in body
    - basic personal information, such as work status (in-service or not),
      position, education and work experiences, etc.
    - applying position
    - applying approach, whether recommended by others
  - add an inscriber containing name and contact information (telephone/email)
- attach the resume file named with the same format of the header
