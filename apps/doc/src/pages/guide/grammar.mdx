# Grammar

## Content

Conciseness is the most important for a resume, and the core contents consist of
basic and objective information:

- personal information
  - important contact information such as telephone, e-mail must be clear
- education backgrounds
  - if you are a fresh graduate, you can add education background of high school
- professional skills
- awards
- work (internship) experiences

Be cautious to add subjective information:

- self-evaluation
- personal hobbies
- social activities, volunteer experiences, etc., which have no clear
  relations with the applied position

Be cautious to add objective information that are unrelated with the applied
position:

- photos
- birthday
- home address
- nationality
- political identity
- marital and family status

Prohibited contents:

- "My Resume" as the title
- watermarks of logos on resume templates from different sources

## Spelling

Spelling mistakes in a resume is a big taboo when applying for jobs. Too many
primary spelling mistakes will make bad first impressions of applicants on
employers. Most software have the spelling check function, using it
appropriately can avoid many primary spelling errors. Of course, you can never
rely too much on the software's spelling check, it's better to find a trusted
friend for proof-reading.

### Proper nouns

Besides common spelling mistakes, there are highly frequent spelling mistakes in
proper nouns, because they are more case sensitive. The same combination of
letters with different capitalization may have completely different meanings in
various fields, job seekers must be very cautious. For example,
[iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios/) with lowercase "i" represents the mobile
operating system on an Apple iPhone, while
[IOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS) with uppercase "I" is the
dedicated system on a Cisco router.

Limited to our background, we summarize some common spelling errors in the IT
domain.

## Syntax

Compared with ordinary writing, there are some special grammar requirements for
resume writing.

- generally use the past tense, but If you are describing the present work or
  education experience, use the present tense
- generally begin an item with a verb in the past tense, omitting the subject
- try to use simple and short sentences that are easy to understand, instead of
  long and complex clauses
- list education backgrounds and work experiences in flashbacks, and the time
  format should be accurate to month
- use the standard time format like "2015.05", or format that can be definitely
  interpreted, such as "June, 2016", instead of year abbreviations like "05/06",
  which can be interpreted differently in different countries
