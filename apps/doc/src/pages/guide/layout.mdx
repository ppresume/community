# Layout

Typesetting is like building a two-dimensional architecture.

If the text and its fonts are the materials for construction, then the layout
design is the architectural drawing. Before discussing the design of layout, we
need to make some of the basic concepts clear, especially the unit system of
font size in typography.

## Font size

Font size is the standard measure of the characters' size in text. The
international universal unit of font size is the point.

The [point](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)>) is usually
abbreviated as pt, it's the smallest unit of measure in typography. In fact,
the size of the point has varied throughout the history of printing. Since the
18th century, the point's size has varied from 0.18 to 0.4 mm. Following the
advent of [desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing)
in the 1980s and 1990s, [digital
printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_printing) has largely supplanted
the [letterpress printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) and
gradually established the DTP point as the facto standard.

The DTP point is defined as 1/72 of an
[inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch).

Most fonts will make the best effects when set to 10-12 pt. In other words, both
the strokes and structure of characters themselves and the spacing between
characters will present relatively good visual effects in such size. The larger
the font size, the looser the text appears, so you need to manually decrease the
character spacing; on the other hand, the smaller the font size, the more
compact the text appears, so you need to manually increase the character
spacing.

| pt  | mm     | cm      | pica | inch |
| --- | ------ | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1   | 0.3528 | 0.03528 | 1/12 | 1/72 |

## Leading

Leading or line-spacing refers to the distance between the baselines of two
consecutive lines.

The ideal leading is at least 120% of the text's font size, generally 1.2-1.5
times are recommended. Different fonts have different x-height, in principle,
the larger the x-height of the font applied, the larger the leading should be,
conversely, the smaller the x-height, the smaller the leading.

## Page layout

Layout is the outline of typesetting, it's like the head-rope of a fishing net,
once the head-rope is raised up, all the meshes spread naturally. In addition to
general typesetting rules for font size and leading, there are some unique
requirements in resume layout design. In principle, it's best to control the
resume in one page.

- Making the language clear and concise
- Adjusting the font size and leading within a reasonable range
- Keeping page margins in 10-25 mm and making the left and right margins
  symmetrical
- Using lists rather than parallel sentences to list information
- Using flush left alignment, taking caution to use justified alignment
  - Justified alignment may cause problems in hyphenation and
    letter-spacing because the lengths of words are different
