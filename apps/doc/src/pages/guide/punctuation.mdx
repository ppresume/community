# Punctuation

Punctuation is the most humble but also most error-prone part in resume writing.
Whether or not the usage of punctuation is correct and standardized reflects the
attitude of job applicants.

To apply correct and standardized punctuation may seem easy, but actually not.
The main reason is that there is no definite specification for punctuation usage
in different situations, or there are specifications but no clear-cut rules, or
there exist multiple sets of style guidelines ([Style
Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide)), but they are incompatible or
even conflicted with each other. We will attempt to summarize some universal
rules for your reference here.

- MUST, adding one space after commas, periods, semicolons, colons, exclamation
  marks and question marks
- MUST, adding one space before an open bracket and after a closed bracket, same
  as a word, but no space after a closed bracket followed by a comma
- RECOMMEND, adding one space between a number and its unit
- RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a hyphen, sometimes necessary to fine-tune
  the letter-spacing
- RECOMMEND, not adding spaces around a slash which locates two parallel things
  like "A or B"
- RECOMMEND, using quotation marks (" ' ", " ' ", " " ", " " "), instead of
  [apostrophes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe)
- SHOULD NOT, adding any punctuation mark at the end of items in a [Bullet
  list](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)>)
- MUST NOT, hanging a punctuation mark at the start of a line, which can be
  avoided by software's automatic settings or manual adjustment

## Connective mark

Hyphen (-), en-dash (--), and em-dash (---) are extremely easy to be confused,
thus cause errors in typesetting. The usage of them is described below.

> for a hyphen, type a hyphen (-);
>
> for an en-dash, type two hyphens (-\\/-);
>
> for an em-dash, type three hyphens (-\\/-\\/-);
>
> for a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode (\\$-\$).

### Hyphen (-)

The hyphen is used primarily for:

- compound words such as "upper-case letter"
- separating numbers or characters, such as telephone numbers, "1-888-777-666"
- hyphenating the word at the end of a line to keep the whole layout neat

There are a few rules about hyphenation at the end of a line:

- trying not to hyphenate the last word in more than three continuous lines
- avoiding dividing proper nouns, personal names, etc.
- avoiding cross-page hyphenation
- segmenting words according to syllables in principle, however the position to
  hyphenate varies with words, so it's better to check dictionaries if
  necessary[^7]

### En-dash (--)

The length of an en-dash equals the width of uppercase "N", and is half of the
length of an em-dash. It's mainly used for:

- indicating the spans of numbers, such as dates in a year, "July--August 1968"
- connecting the start and end of addresses, such as "Boston--Hartford route"

When using an en-dash, generally it's not recommended to add spaces around it.

### Em-dash (---)

The length of an em-dash equals the width of uppercase "M", and its usage is the
most flexible and complex. The em-dash is usually used for:

- explaining something in details, equivalent to parentheses or colons
- segmenting declarative clauses
- indicating that the conversation is interrupted, in which case an
  ellipsis may also be used

In addition, there are situations where two or three em-dashes are joined
together, but not to be detailed here[^8].

    Professional typesetting software generally have automatic
    hyphenating function, to some extents it can locate the position for
    hyphenation if turned on, but it's best to artificially check
    again.
