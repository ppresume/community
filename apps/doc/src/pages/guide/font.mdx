# Font

As text transmits information, the visual feature of the text
itself---font---will affect the quality of transmission.

In principle, the typesetting of a resume should be concise and clear. As for
font, first you should never use fonts that are too fancy, second the types of
fonts should not be too many---best limited in three. Here we will discuss some
basics of fonts and main points in typesetting.

## Font classification

### Serif vs. sans-serif

In terms of serifs, fonts for Latin alphabet are divided into two families:
serif and sans-serif[^1].

A serif is a tiny line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter. A font with
serifs is called serif font, or serifed font. In contrast, a font without serifs
is called sans-serif font, from the French _sans_, meaning "without".

### Proportional vs. monospaced

According to whether or not the widths of characters are the same, fonts can be
divided into monospaced and proportional. As the name suggests, all letters in a
monospaced font occupy the same amount of horizontal space, while in a
proportional font they don't.

In traditional printing, proportional fonts can improve the legibility of words.
Due to technical limitations, the early computers and typewriters can not adjust
the widths of characters. So all characters are made into the same width, thus
monospaced fonts come into being. With the improvement of computer technology,
the GUI(graphical user interface) has become the mainstream and been developing
continuously; technical limitations no longer exist, so proportional fonts have
become quite popular, since they are more naturally legible for human.

## Font design and usage

Digital Publishing has been developing for many years, and the writing system of
English or other similar languages actually has a very small character set, so
there are many many kinds of fonts designed by different people with various
demands.

For a monospaced font, the main focus is on the design of each single letter,
other than that, in a proportional font, the space between letters should also
be seriously considered.

### Letter composition

Letters in every font have a consistent structure, font users are supposed to
know these basic concepts:

- baseline: the invisible line on which "H" or "n" stands
- cap height: the distance from baseline to the top of a linear uppercase letter
  like "H" or "E"
- x-height: the distance from the bottom to the top of lowercase "x"
- ascender: the ascending parts of lowercase letters like "b", "d", "f", "h",
  "k", "l" over the top of "x" , its height is called the ascender height, the top
  line which ascenders align is called the ascender line
- descender: the descending parts of lowercase letters like "g", "j", "p", "q",
  "y" below the baseline, its height is called the descender height, the bottom
  line which descenders align is called the descender line

### Letter-spacing

Letter-spacing, or tracking, refers to the space between letters.
Letter-spacing adjustment is divided into font designers' side and font users'
side; it affects the density in a line or block of text.

For font designers, adjusting the letter-spacing is an important procedure in
designing. In a proportional font, the spacing on the left side of a single
letter does not necessarily equal that on the right side. The purpose is to
ensure readability when the letter is adjacent to whatever other letters on
either side.

For font users, the letter-spacing adjustment means manually rearranging the
space between letters by software after the original typesetting, in order to
obtain special alignment[^2], or a better layout effect[^3].

### Kerning

Kerning refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the space between
specific letter pairs in a proportional font. These pairs are called kerning
pairs. Kerning is more concerned about the visual spacing rather than the actual
spacing.

Designers of many fonts will pay attention to kerning pairs while designing, and
store kerning adjustment values in the font file. In this way, typesetting
software can automatically adjust spacing for kerning pairs according to the
values, thus produce a better layout effect.

Every letter has a unique shape, so during the design and implementation of a
font, letters in all kerning pairs must cooperate to produce the best visual
effect. In fact, this is where the key procedure and difficulties lie[^4].

### Ligature

A ligature is a glyph that joins two or more letters together.

Printing ligatures originate from letters combined in handwriting. After the
birth of movable-type printing, many ligatures were directly made into type.
However, in the 1950s, sans-serif fonts began to be widely used, and in the
1970s phototypesetting was invented, so gradually ligatures were rarely used.
The earliest software that could use ligatures for digital typesetting is TeX
created by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth). This
trend also affected the typesetting technology on computer desktop after 1985.
In early times, software could not replace letters with ligatures(but TeX
could), and most of the newly made fonts for computers did not include
ligatures. Furthermore, early personal computers mostly displayed English, and
ligatures are not necessary for English, so there was no real need. With the
development of digital typesetting technology such as
[OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType), ligatures have gradually
returned to practice[^5].

In general daily business documents, absence of ligatures will not be treated as
spelling error, but for professional typesetting in advertising, book publishing
and other fields, ligatures are essentially required.

### Italics

Italics are fonts in which the letters slant slightly to the right. Italics are
based on normal font style, and refer to italic type or oblique type[^6].

In italic type, forms of letters are changed compared with the normal type,
while in oblique type, letters are merely tilted right without any modification
on the forms. Oblique type is simply realized through algorithms by software, as
a result, the strokes of letters will appear loose. Recently, more and more
designs are inclined to apply newly designed italic type.

Theoretically, italics include italic type and oblique type, but it should be
noticed that actually not all italic type are slanted .

In practice, italics are usually applied to one piece of text to emphasize or
distinguish it from the main body that is in serif fonts.

### Combined font solution

There are tons of fonts out there nowadays, so to commend a universal combined
font solution for resumes is not so easy as it may seem to be.

- RECOMMEND, using serif fonts in the main body
- RECOMMEND, using sans-serif fonts for titles, but serif fonts can also be used
- RECOMMEND, using italic fonts to emphasize text in main body, corresponding
  bold style can also be used

    When the width of layout is small, usually it's not suitable to
    use justified alignment, because applying justified alignment will
    force most software to adjust the letter-spacing, and often, the
    final layout effect will be very bad.
