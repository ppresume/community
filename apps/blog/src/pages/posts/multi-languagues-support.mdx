## Introduction

I am thrilled that
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ppresume-supports-multi-languages)
has taken a big step forward to support multi languages, starting with Chinese, with 3 variants, [Simplified
Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters),
[Traditional
Chinese Hong
Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters#Hong_Kong_and_Macau)
and [Traditional Chinese
Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters#Taiwan).

PPResume was designed from the ground up to support [internationalization and
localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization),
and I finally got some time to implement this recently. As far as I know,
**PPResume should be the only resume builder on the market that supports multi
languages while following best typesetting practices.**

From now on, you can specify a language when creating new resumes:

You can also switch language for existing resumes:

![Switch Resume Language](/static/images/multi-languages-support/switch-resume-language.webp)

When switching languages, all idioms and conventions of the target language are
strictly observed.

Here are some sample resumes.

- English resume:

- Simplified Chinse resume:

- Traditional Chinese HK resume:

- Traditional Chinese TW resume:

If you look closely, you will notice that although there are many similarities
between English resumes and Chinese resumes, there are still two major
differences in terms of typesetting:

1. there is no italics in Chinese resumes so all dates are not italicized as in
   English resume, as it is considered [bad
   practice](https://drwhispers.com/2021/11/16/italics-in-chinese/) to use italics
   in Chinese typesetting
2. [numbers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-typeset-numbers-1077695) in English
   resumes are old style, while Chinese resumes use lining style

All I can tell you here is that supporting multi languages is not as simple as
translating a list of words from one language to another language, as
aforementioned, you have to follow target languages' conventions and idioms.
Typesetting practices with mixed languages is another big topic as well. If you
are not a tech guy, you can close this tab and take a break. However, if you do
want know the nuts and guts, you can stay and continue reading this post.

## Engineering

OK, you are not closing this tab, let us dive a little more into the tech
details here.

Technically, there are two categories of things to do when supporting multi
languages:

- [Internationalization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-internationalization-i18n),
  often abbreviated as "i18n" (where the number 18 represents the 18 characters
  between "i" and "n"), is basically a set of practices that allow a product
  support multi languages, i18n main consists of translating the product into
  mutli languages and dynamically switching the language according to the user's
  choice
- [Localization](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/internationalization-vs-localization/#what-is-localization-l10n),
  often abbreviated as "l10n" (the number 10 represents the characters between
  "l" and "n"), it goes beyond mere translation and instead adapts the product
  to the cultural specifics of the target language.

In practice, i18n always comes first, l10n comes after. For multi languages
support in PPResume, we have made the following efforts to get the best l10n for
resumes in addition to the pure i18n translation.

### Date

Resumes often use a lot of dates for work experience and education background
items. Dates are presented differently in English and Chinese, e.g. "Jun 2018 –
Present" in English should be translated as "2018 年 6 月至今" in Chinese，the
position of the year and month should be reversed, and the en-dash "–" should be
replaced by "至".

With JavaScript, you can use
[Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString)
to get localized string output for a `Date` object.

### Old Style Numbers

Old style numbers, also known as [text
figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures), designed with varying
heights in a fashion that resembles a typical line of running text, hence the
name.

![Text Figures](/static/images/multi-languages-support/440px-Text_figures.jpg)

In contrast, lining style numbers (also called lining, titling or modern
figures), have the same height as upper-case characters.

PPResume defaults to old style numbers for English resumes and lining style numbers
for Chinese resumes. Why? Because Chinese characters all have the same height and
width (that is why Chinese characters are also called "方块字", which means square
characters), basically all Chinese characters are titled by nature. By adopting
numbers in the lining style, the number style is adapted more closely to the
Chinese characters.

> High-quality typesetting generally prefers text figures in body text: they
> integrate better with lowercase letters and small capitals, unlike runs of
> lining figures. Lining figures are called for in all-capitals settings (hence
> the alternative name titling figures), and may work better in tables and
> spreadsheets.

### Traditional Chinese Variants

Traditional Chinese has at least two variants, namely, the Hong Kong variant
[zh-HK](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locale-code/zh-HK/) and the Taiwan
variant [zh-TW](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locale-code/zh-TW/). Most of the
scripts in zh-HK and zh-TW are identical, with only a few minor differences.

For example, the word "software", when translated to zh-HK, it is "軟件", while
in zh-TW, it is "軟體". There are at least tens of words in English that are
translated differently in zh-HK and zh-TW, check
[here](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B9%81%E4%BD%93%E5%AD%97#%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E%E5%B7%AE%E7%95%B0).

[OpenCC](https://github.com/byvoid/opencc) is an open source project that can
perform convensions between Simplified and Traditional Chinese, with support for
both zh-HK and zh-TW.

In general, PPResume can't do too much for the difference between zh-HK and
zh-TW , as users have to decide which variant to use when writing resumes and
make sure that the content conforms to the idioms and convensions of zh-HK or
zh-TW. However, there is one thing that PPResume needs to handle properly for
zh-HK and zh-TW, as some countries have different names in zh-HK and zh-TW.
[Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia), for example, is
translated as "沙特阿拉伯" in zh-HK and "沙烏地阿拉伯" in zh-TW. There are also a few other
countries. PPResume takes care of all countries that has different translations
in zh-HK and zh-TW.

### Location

The address formats differ between English and Chinese conventions. In
English, the smaller segment, such as the address line, town and county comes
first, follows by city, state and country, while in Chinese the order is
totally reversed.

Don't worry, PPResume has already handled this for you.

### Punctuations

#### Comma

English uses the comma `,` as a separator to separate parts of a sentence and
items in a list, while Chinese uses a Chinese comma `，` to separate sensences,
and a dedicated enumeration comma
([顿号](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#East_Asia), `、`) to separate items in
a list (e.g. keyword list).

With PPResume's [TagsInput](https://mantine.dev/core/tags-input/) component for
the input of `keywords` and `courses`, the correct seperator punctuations are
used according to the main language of the resume.

#### Colon

English and Chinese also have
[different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms) colons.
The [English colon](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+003A) is `:`, with
Unicode `U+003A`, while the [Chinese
colon](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+FF1A) is `：`, with Unicode `U+FF1A`.

As you can always trust, PPResume also takes care of this. You may wonder, how
does PPResume deal with this?

Under the hood, PPResume uses [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) as the
current default template. Since moderncv defines a macro
[`\cvitemwithcomment`](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/blob/453d694/moderncvbodyiii.sty#L187-L194),
we need to override this colon in [line
188](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/blob/453d694/moderncvbodyiii.sty#L188)
based on the main language of the resume. Hence the code:

```tex
<= #layout.computed.environment.isCJK =>
% renew moderncv command to adapt for CJK colon
\renewcommand*{\cvitem}[3][.25em]{%
  \ifstrempty{#2}{}{\hintstyle{#2}<= &templateTranslations.punctuations.Colon =>}{#3}%
  \par\addvspace{#1}}

\renewcommand*{\cvitemwithcomment}[4][.25em]{%
  \savebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}{\ifstrempty{#2}{}{\hintstyle{#2}<= &templateTranslations.punctuations.Colon =>}#3}%
  \setlength{\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}{\widthof{\usebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}}}%
  \setlength{\cvitemwithcommentcommentlength}{\maincolumnwidth-\separatorcolumnwidth-\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}%
  \begin{minipage}[t]{\cvitemwithcommentmainlength}\usebox{\cvitemwithcommentmainbox}\end{minipage}%
  \hfill% fill of \separatorcolumnwidth
  \begin{minipage}[t]{\cvitemwithcommentcommentlength}\raggedleft\small\itshape#4\end{minipage}%
  \par\addvspace{#1}}
<= /layout.computed.environment.isCJK =>
```

Here `templateTranslations.punctuations.Colon` is a dynamic variable that would
be assigned to the correct colon based on the main language of the resume.

### CJK Font

Last but not least, the size of the CJK character set is huge and many fonts are
missing glyphs for some CJK characters, resulting in an empty sqaure placeholder
in the final PDF output, which is ugly and strange.

Under the hood, we use [CTeX](https://github.com/CTeX-org/ctex-kit) for CJK
typesetting. By default, CTeX offers the six `fontset` choices to choose from:

- adobe: use fonts provided by Adobe
- fandol: use [fandol](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/fandol?lang=en) fonts
- founder: use fonts provided by [Founder](https://fonts.adobe.com/foundries/foundertype)
- mac: use default system fonts available on mac
- ubuntu: use default system fonts available on ubuntu
- windows: use default system fonts available on windows

`adobe`, `mac` and `windows` fonts are not available for commercial use; a few
`founder` fonts are free for commercial use, but must be downloaded and
installed manually; `fandol` fonts is available in the standard texlive
distribution, however, some commonly used Chinese characters such as `瑢`, `樭`
are [missing](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/33). `ubuntu` font
seems to be our last choice, however, by default, `ubuntu` font use
`gkai00mp.ttf: AR PL KaitiM GB,文鼎ＰＬ简中楷:style=Regular` for [Kai
form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CJK_fonts#Regular_script), some
commonly used Traditional Chinese characters such as `學`, `績` are [not
available](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/63#issuecomment-2206043675).

So what can we do then? Fortunately, there are some good, high quality CJK fonts
available free for commercial use which also has a good coverage of the
character set for both Simplified and Traditional Chinese. Thanks to Google and
Adobe, [Noto Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/fonts) are licensed under the
Open Font License. You can use them in all your products and projects — print or
digital, commercial or otherwise.

To use the Noto fonts in LaTeX, you must first install them:

```sh
# if you are on macOS
brew install font-noto-sans-cjk font-noto-serif-cjk

# if you are on Ubuntu
apt install -y fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-cjk-extra
```

Then set Noto Fonts as the main CJK font for xeCJK in the LaTeX preamble:

```tex
% ctex settings
% ref: http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/language/chinese/ctex/ctex.pdf
\usepackage[UTF8, fontset=none]{ctex}

\setCJKmainfont{Noto Serif CJK SC}
\setCJKsansfont{Noto Sans CJK SC}
\setCJKfamilyfont{zhsong}{Noto Serif CJK SC}
\setCJKfamilyfont{zhhei}{Noto Sans CJK SC}
```

You are all set then. Feel free to enter any CJK characters in your LaTeX
documents and compile them with [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/), you should be
good to go.

## Look Ahead

OK, long enough boring tech details, time to close this tab :-). But before you
close this tab, I want to tell you that, the groundwork has been done and it
won't be too hard for PPResume to support more languages, Japanese, French,
Spanish, etc. Stay tuned!

You can close this tab now.
