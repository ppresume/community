## Introduction

I am super excited that
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ppresume-supports-multi-languages)
has made a big step forward to support multi languages, starting from Chinese
languages, with 3 variants, [Simplified
Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters),
[Traditional
Chinese Hong
Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters#Hong_Kong_and_Macau)
and [Traditional Chinese
Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters#Taiwan).

PPResume was designed from the bottom up to support
[internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization) and I
finally got some time recently to implement this. As far as I know, **PPResume
should be the only resume builder on the market that supports multi languages
while still follows best typesetting practices.**

From now on, you can specify a language when creating a new resume:

You can also switch language for existing resumes:

When switch langugages, all idioms, conventions of the target language will be
strictly obeyed.

When switching languages, all idioms and conventions of the target language will
be strictly observed.

Let's check some ample resumes:

## Engineering

OK, a bit more tech details here. Supporting multi languages is not as easy as
translating some English phrases, you have to follow target languages' idioms,
conventions, and typesetting best practices when mixing different languages.
Here are some nitty gritty details:

### Datetime

datetime has different display convention between English and Chinese, for
example, `Jun 2018 – Present` in English will be translated to `2018 年 6 月至今` in
Chinese，the position of the year and the month should be reversed, and the
en-dash `–` should be removed.

### Number Styles

Number styles in English and Chinese resumes can be different, we can apply
OldStyle numbers in English, while adopting Lining style numbers for Chinese
resumes, just make the glyph style align with host language.

### Traditional Chinese Variants

Traditional Chinese has at least Hong Kong and Taiwan variants, and one
country can have slightly different names in HK and TW Traditional Chinese,
better to take care of this.

### Location

Locations. The address format are different between English and Chinese
conventions. In English, the smaller segment, like the address line, town comes
first, then follows by city, state and country, while in Chinese, the order is
totally reversed.

### Punctuations

Punctuations. English use comma as the separator, while Chinese has dedicated
separator (顿号 `、`) to separates items in a list (like Keywords list), better to
handle this as well.

### CJK Font

Last but not least, CJK character set is huge and many typefaces are missing
glyphs for many CJK characters and we have tested carefully to make the right
choice for CJK fonts. Here we choose Noto Sans/Serif as the default font for
CJK.

## Look ahead

The foundational work has been settled down, it won't be too hard to support
more languages, Japanese, French, Spanish, etc. Stay tuned with us!
