## Introduction

I am very pleased to announce that
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=introducing-ppresume-pwa)
is now a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app).

This is the result of several weeks of hard work. From now on, you can install
PPResume as a standalone app on your devices, with improved performance, lower
network latency and bandwidth cost, and an excellent user experience under weak
or even offline network conditions.

Let us take a quick look first:

## What is a PWA?

The [birth of the iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg) ushered
in a new era of mobile computing. When the iPhone 1 was released in 2007, it has
a 3.5-inch display, with a mobile version of Safari for surfing the web. And the
web was the only way to deliver apps to the iPhone at that time. As you can see,
most websites back then were designed for desktop devices—only a small portion
of [wap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol) websites
were designed for mobiles—so you have to pinch your fingers to zoom in and out
in order to browse the websites on mobile devices.

Needless to say, the iPhone is a revolutionary mobile device, it was so
successful that mobile first design became a trend afterwards as more and more
traffic comes from mobiles.

At Apple's [WWDC in 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubm2dYzoDW8), Steve
Jobs announced that the iPhone would "run applications created with Web 2.0
Internet standards". No SDK was required, and there was no App Store. All apps
were simply websites designed for mobile devices and delivered via the Safari
browser engine.

However, the web standards back then were too weak to provide a good and
consistent user
experience—[HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/) was first
released to the public in January 2008, and it took 6 years to gain W3C
Recommendation status in October 2014! People were not happy with web apps,
developers were frustrated and Apple had to change its strategy. In October
2007, Steve Jobs announced that an SDK would be launched the following year. In
July 2008, Apple released [iPhone OS
2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_2) for the iPhone, along with the
[App Store](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)>). From then on,
the vast majority of iOS applications shifted to the App Store.

The App Store has proven to be a great success. It provides a central location
where users can find, download and install apps. It also provides developers
with a secure and reliable way to distribute their apps to users. The App Store
ecosystem has been so successful that it has been adopted by other platforms
such as Google Play, Windows Store and Amazon Appstore etc. It has nurtured a
whole new mobile app ecosystem. The first thing most users do when they open
their phone is to find a suitable app and open it, or install it from the App
Store if it is not already installed—the App Store has become an essential part
of the mobile experience.

The App Store ecosystem continues to thrive, but the web has not stopped
evolving either. With the advent of
[HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/), [ECMAScript
6.0](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
and many other powerful [web
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)s, the web has become more
powerful and capable than ever before.

In 2010, [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) published an article on [A
List Apart](https://alistapart.com/), in which he introduced the concept of
[Responsive Web Design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/).
Responsive Web Design is a design approach that aims to create websites that can
adapt and fit to the vast majority of devices, from desktop computers to
mobiles. The core idea of responsive web design is the use of [CSS media
queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries) to
apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as
screen size, orientation, and resolution, etc.

In 2015, designer [Frances Berriman](https://fberriman.com/) and her husband
[Alex Russell](https://infrequently.org/), a Google Chrome engineer, coined the
term "Progressive Web Apps" in a blog post of Alex: [Progressive Web Apps: Escaping
Tabs Without Losing Our
Soul](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/).

> - Responsive: to fit any form factor
> - Connectivity independent: Progressively-enhanced with Service Workers to let

> - Fresh: Transparently always up-to-date thanks to the Service Worker update

> - Safe: Served via TLS (a Service Worker requirement) to prevent snooping
> - Discoverable: Are identifiable as "applications" thanks to W3C Manifests and
>   Service Worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them
> - Re-engageable: Can access the re-engagement UIs of the OS; e.g. Push

> - Installable: to the home screen through browser-provided prompts, allowing

From my perspective, a PWA is still **web** at its core, however, it aims to
provide an **app**-like user experience through **progressive** enhancement to a
website.

So here comes the question: Why PWA?

## Why PWA

Since the invention of the web, there have been two major ways to deliver
services to users:

- native apps, which are specifically designed for a specific platform, such as
  Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.
- web apps, which are designed to be accessed through a web browser on any
  device.

From a user perspective, native apps usually offer a better user experience, the
best performance and the ability to use all the features of your devices.
However, users need to take the time to download and install the app.

On the other hand, web apps are accessible via a web browser without the need to
download and install anything, and users always get the latest web apps
automatically. However, the user experience is usually not as good as native
apps, especially on mobile devices, and web apps can not take advantage of all
the capabilities of your devices because they run in browsers and rely on
browser implementations to connect to device-specific features.

From a developer's perspective, developing and maintaining native apps for
multiple platforms is very costly, and the app store review process can be
lengthy and risky, while for web apps, it only involves a single codebase that
can run on multiple platforms, and it's super easy to release updates to web apps
since there are no app stores in between the middle.

Last but not least, web apps are essentially open and free, they are based on
open standards, they can be usedon any device with a browser, and most
importantly, there is no [benevolent
dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship) deciding which
web apps may be delivered to the public according to some kinds of app store
guidelines. Freedom is priceless, isn't it?

Given the list of pros and cons of native apps and web apps, why should you
bother with PWA? **In a word, PWA gives you the best of both worlds.**

At its core, PWA is still a web app that can be accessed via any web browser; it
is discoverable and can be indexed by search engines and gain free organic
traffic; it is built on top of URL and linkable by default, meaning it is
zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share. With the progressive
enhancement, it can get many features that are only available for native apps,
such as:

- **installable**: PWA can be installed as an independent app via the browser
  prompt or App Store.
- **discoverable**: PWA has its own icon on your desktop, dock or home screen
  on your devices after installation
- **standalone window**: PWA has its own window after installation, so you won't
  be lost in the sea of tabs in your browser
- **better performance**: PWA can utilize service worker to cache assets and
  data, so you don't have download the same assets and data over and over again
  from a remote server, drastically reduces the network latency and bandwidth
  cost, resulting in a more responsive user experience
- **offline support**: PWA can work offline partially, as long as a page has
  been visited, you can continue to use it in read only mode when offline.
- **push notification**: PWA can send push notifications to users, to re-engage
  users and bring them back to the app.
- **native integrations**: PWA can utilize other native features of your
  devices, such as camera, microphone, GPS, etc. with the integration of [web
  APIs](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/capabilities#empowering_your_pwa), check [What
  PWA Can Do Today](https://whatpwacando.today/) for example

Overall PWA is an "invest small earn big" effort to provide the web with an
app-like experience by progressive enhancement. By progressive enhancement, it
means that you don't have to do all the enhancements at once, instead, you can
start with the basic features and progressively enhance it with more advanced
features. First make your website responsive, then make it installable by
creating a manifest file, then adopt service worker to make it work offline,
then integrate other advanced features. Agility, fast iteration, that's the
spirit of web development, and that's all you need to create a PWA.

## Show Time

OK long story short, it is show time now.

## Future Improvements

PPResume PWA is far from perfect, there is still a lot of room for improvement.
Here is a list of features and bug fixes that I am still working on:

- feature enhancement
  - provide rich install UI: [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/46)
  - custom offline page: [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/49)
  - respect system dark mode, [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/52)
  - submit app to various stores, [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/50)
- bug fix:
  - fix black splash screen on iOS, [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/54)
- docs:
  - documentation for PPResume PWA, [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/56)
- test:
  - check PPResume PWA campatibility on different devices,
    [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/57)

There are also lots of engineering details that are worth a deep dive, such as:

- how to create a good looking web app manifest
- how to utilize service worker to cache assets and data
- how to deal with CORS issues when caching CDN assets
- which library to use for Next.js PWA implementation

However I will save these topics for future blog posts, otherwise it would be
too long to have a pleasant reading experience.

Stay tuned!
