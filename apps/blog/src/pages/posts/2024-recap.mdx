## Introduction

PPResume was [launched on Sep 6,
2023](https://x.com/xiaohanyu1988/status/1699430029132726388), after which I
spent some time fixing bugs, and then spent another 2 weeks learning how to make
my first product marketing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYqSTsCw3KI).
At Oct 31, 2023, I wrote an official blog post about the
[launch](/posts/introducing-ppresume).

By the end of 2023, PPResume has 177 users, this number becomes 1725 by the end
of 2024. With a math on the letters, the number of new users per month in 2023
is $177/4 = 44.25$, while in 2024, it is $(1725 - 177)/12 = 129$. Over the year,
people have created 1402 resumes on PPResume.

```sql
logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at <= '2024-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00';
 count
-------
   177
(1 row)

logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at < '2025-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00';
 count
-------
  1725
(1 row)

api=> select count(*) from resumes where created_at >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00' and created_at < '2025-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00' and deleted = false;
 count
-------
  1402
(1 row)

api=> select count(distinct owner_id) from resumes where created_at >= '2024-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00' and created_at < '2025-01-01 00:00:00.000000+00' and deleted = false;
 count
-------
  1326
(1 row)
```

There are a lot of other interesting metrics, along with some learnings for
bootstrapping a SaaS product as a one man team, whic is why this post is here.

## Metrics

- 1548 new sign up users
- 1402 resumes created
- 1326 users created at least one resume
  - 49 users created 2 resumes
  - 4 users created 3 resumes

  - Dec 2024: $0 (heart breaking month...ðŸ’”)

### Web Analytics

In 2024 we got a total of 42.4k unique visitors for 3 sites:

| Site                              | Unique Visitors | Total Visits | Total Pageviews | Bounce Rate | Visit Duration |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)  | 16.6k           | 19.1k        | 36.6k           | 50.2%       | 2:56           |
| [Blog](https://blog.ppresume.com) | 24.3k           | 25.8k        | 32k             | 46.5%       | 3:21           |
| [Docs](https://docs.ppresume.com) | 1.5k            | 1.6k         | 4.3k            | 1:32        | 62.3%          |

We got several spikes in the number of unique visitors for the main site the
blog, that is because we were featured by some top channels, I will talk
more about it [later](#the-good).

- China
- United States
- Hong Kong
- Singapore
- Japan
- India
- Taiwan
- Canada
- Germany
- United Kingdom

![ppresume 2024

### Top Pages

The top 5 pages are:

- [landing page](https://ppresume.com): welcome to PPResume
- [dashboard](https://ppresume.com/dashboard): sign in and manage resumes
- [gallery](https://ppresume.com/gallery): a list of public sample resumes
- [pricing](https://ppresume.com/pricing): pricing plan
- [settings](https://ppresume.com/settings): user settings, billing info, etc.

![ppresume 2024
metrics main site top
pages](/static/images/2024-recap/ppresume-2024-metrics-main-site-top-pages.webp)

- $3.2k/15.3k = 20.9\%$ of the visitors signed in and accessed their dashboard.
- $1.1k/15.3k = 7.2\%$ of the visitors checked our [pricing
  plan](https://ppresume.com/pricing)â€”please note that the pricing plan was
  only launched at Sep 29, 2024, so the numbers here should be much higher if
  you only count the users who signed up after the pricing plan was launched.
- $1.3k/15.3k = 8.5\%$ of the visitors were interested in the [gallery
  showcase](https://ppresume.com/gallery)â€”please note that the gallery page was
  launched around Aug 2024.

### SEO

[Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)'s metrics are a bit better, the
[DR](https://ahrefs.com/domain-rating) has been increased from 0 to 17, with a
spike of 25 (the day after when the post [on typesetting
engine](/posts/on-typesetting-engine) was [featured by Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100660)), I guess the result is not
too bad.

## New Features

I've introduced a bunch of new features to PPResume in 2024, here are some of
them with the link to the blog post and the estimated working days.

| Feature                                                       | Working Days |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [The New Auth Flow](/posts/introducting-the-new-auth-flow)    | 30           |
| [Google Sign In](/posts/introducing-google-sign-in)           | 10           |
| [PWA](/posts/introducing-ppresume-pwa)                        | 20           |
| [Multi Languages Support](/posts/multi-languagues-support)    | 15           |
| [Pricing Plan](/posts/introducing-the-pricing-plan)           | 40           |
| [No Vendor Lock-In with LaTeX Code](/posts/no-vendor-lock-in) | 15           |
| [Multi Templates](/posts/2-new-moderncv-templates)            | 20           |

## The Good

### Top Tier Sign Up Rate

> According to WordStream's benchmark report, the average Sign Up Rate for SaaS
> websites ranges between 2% to 5%, with top performing sites converting at
> more than 11%.
>
> â€” [Sign Up Rate](https://www.metrichq.org/marketing/sign-up-rate/)

PPResume's sign up rate is 9.3%, which is pretty good and close to the top tier.
I guess this is mostly due to PPResume's clean, sharp and elegant UI/UX design.

### Featured by ruanyifeng/weekly

[ruanyifeng/weekly](https://github.com/ruanyf/weekly) is a top, Chinese tech
newsletter, maintained by [Ruan Yifeng](https://ruanyifeng.com/).

PPResume was featured twice in 2024:

- [Weekly Issue
  297](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/04/weekly-issue-297.html):
  the product itself was featured, which brings 1.2k+ visits to the website and
  **183 new signups** in one day.
- [Weekly Issue
  326](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/11/weekly-issue-326.html), the blog
  post [On Typesetting Engine](/posts/on-typesetting-engine) was featured at Nov
  22, 2024, which brings 2.2k visits to the blog site and 329 visits to the main
  site, however it only brings **13 new signups**.

### Featured by Hacker News

The blog post [On Typesetting Engine](/posts/on-typesetting-engine) was
[featured by Hacker News on Nov 11,
2024](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100660), got 151 points in the end,
which brings 9.2k visits the blog site and 725 visits to the main site, however
it brings only **8 new signups**.

The traffic from Hacker News is insane, however the conversion rate is quite
low, I guess there are two reasons here:

1. Most of the Hacker News readers understand tech well and they have the
   ability to create a beautifully typed resume on their own without the need
   for a resume builder.
2. The readers of the blog post are more likely to be interested in the
   technical content about typesetting engines, very few of them have the intent
   to create resumes.

### Finally Got Some Revenue

I've launched the pricing plan on Sep 29, 2024, two weeks later, on Oct 15,
2024, I finally received the first payment of $9.

![ppresume first payment](/static/images/2024-recap/ppresume-first-payment.webp)

Monthly revenue up to the time of writing:

| Month    | Revenue | No. of Payments |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Oct 2024 | $12     | 2               |
| Nov 2024 | $30     | 4               |
| Dec 2024 | $0      | 0               |
| Jan 2025 | $48     | 5               |
| Feb 2025 | $58     | 4               |

## The Bad

### Poor Marketing

First thing first, the marketing performance of PPResume is much worse and more
difficult than what I am originally expected when I started working on PPResume.

This is my first time to get my hands dirty and do marketing for a product
myself. And to be honest, I know nothing about marketing, so I made the wrong
expectation and estimation.

On the Internet you can learn a lot of marketing practices, social networking,
cold emails, etc. but almost none of them are low hanging fruitâ€”it either
takes money or time.

1. Submitting to directories: except for [Product
   Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), other directories bring poor traffic.
   You hardly get any traffic share, and ranking on Product Hunt itself requires
   effort and luck.
2. Social networking: it is quite a lengthy process to grow a social account
   starting with less than 100 followers.
3. Reddit: most high-traffic subreddits have "no self-promotion" rules, posting
   promotions will likely result in subreddit bans or account suspensions.
4. Blogging/SEO: too slow, and you need to write many posts to slowly see
   some effects. According to [ahrefs
   data](https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-rank/), most pages
   that rank in the top positions on Google take 2-3 years to get there,
5. Email marketing: cold emails are likely to be flagged as spam, and data
   compliance requirements are becoming increasingly stringent. Sending bulk
   promotional emails without user consent is likely to be non-compliant with
   regulations such as GDPR. Meanwhile, building an email list to get user
   consent is a full-time job in itself.
6. KOL: some require payment, and KOL traffic would decline to almost zero after
   a month or two.

If you ask me for a recommendation on how to improve the marketing performance,
my answer is: **be prepared, be patient!**

### My Fault on Email Outreach

Many said that email outreach is a good way to get traffic, but it is not as
easy as it looks. On Oct 2024, I started sending cold emails to people who give
Github stars to open source resume builders (such as
[resumake.io](https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io/),
[ReactiveResume](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume)) hoping
that they could give PPResume a try.

I sent about 200 emails in 3 or 4 days and suddenly got a complaint from a guy
saying I'm spamming people:

> Hi,
>
> Spamming people because they make Github stars is against the Github terms of
> service. Please remove me from your list and set technological measures in
> place to ensure I am not added to your list in the future.
>
> Be well,

To be honest, I also got some emails from people based on my Github profile,
which I don't mind too much, so I think this should be OK. Then I checked the
Github ToS and found out that it is [against the rules to send promotional
emails](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#7-information-usage-restrictions)
to people based on their Github profile (another Hacker News
[discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30764662)).

I immediately stopped the cold email outreach, and then replied and apologized
for the mistake:

> Hello,
>
> **First, I am really sorry for that!**
>
> I didn't mean to spam people, but yes, I did make a mistake. Occasionally, I

With today's increasingly stringent compliance requirements, it is very risky to
send cold emails to people in bulk without their consent. How to get user
consent? Emmm, this is a full-time job by itself, you need to provide some value
to them, no wonder top tiers newsletters is a valuable asset.

### Low Organic Traffic

Like many other webmasters, I use [Google Search
Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) to track the organic traffic
performance. Over the whole year PPResume only got only 391 clicks, with 12.5k
impressions, which is pretty low and bad performance.

![ppresume 2024
metrics main site GSC
](/static/images/2024-recap/ppresume-2024-metrics-main-site-gsc.webp)

High performing websites can get thousands of organic clicks from Google search,
This is the ultimate goal of PPResume and I will make it happen one day.

### Low Payment Conversion Rate

As mentioned above, I launched the pricing plan on Sep 29, 2024 and got the
first payment on Oct 15, 2024. Over Oct, Nov and Dec, I only got 6 payments,
which is much less than what I expected.

There may be some possible reasons:

1. The product is still not good enough.
2. Users who signed up prior to the pricing plan do not need to update their
   resumes yet, so they do not need to pay.
3. The price plan is a bit high for the current market (probably not, as most
   competitors charge $10-20/month for subscription).

This is of course a bit disappointing for me. Meanwhile, it is a challenging
task to better monetize the product in 2025, otherwise the product would die, no
wonder.

### Browser Compatibility Issues

At the beginning of 2024, I spent some time [optimized the auth
flow](/posts/introducting-the-new-auth-flow) and introduced [google sign
in](/posts/introducing-google-sign-in), which results to a boost in the sign up
rate. Everything was going well until I got some bug reports from users
mentioning that they could not sign in to their account. After digging into the
issue, I found out that this only happens with Safari 17+ browsers.

This [issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/59) still exists at
the time of writing, I am sorry for the inconvenience, I will fix it this year.

## The Learnings

### KOL Traffic Will Decline

KOL traffic is very juicy, but it will decline to zero after a month or two.

For example, [PPResume](https://ppresume.com) was featured in [ruanyifeng/weekly
297](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/04/weekly-issue-297.html) on April 19,
2024, which brought 1.2k+ visits to [the main site](https://ppresume.com) and
roughly **183 new signups** in one day. However, after a month or two, the
traffic declined to almost zero.

![ppresume.com ruanyifeng
traffic](/static/images/2024-recap/ppresume.com-ruanyifeng-traffic.webp)

The blog post [On Typesetting Engines](/posts/on-typesetting-engine) was
featured again by [ruanyifeng/weekly
326](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/11/weekly-issue-326.html) on Nov 22,
2024, which brought 2.2k visits to the [blog site](https://blog.ppresume.com)
and 329 visits to [the main site](https://ppresume.com), however it only brought
**13 new signups**, again, the traffic declined to zero after a month or two.

![blog.ppresume.com ruanyifeng
traffic](/static/images/2024-recap/blog.ppresume.com-ruanyifeng-traffic.webp)

That being said, **being featured by KOLs is still a good way to get traffic,
however you should lower your expectations on the traffic, don't expect it to
bring you traffic constantly for a long time**. You have to work hard to keep
the traffic coming.

### Not All Traffic Are Created Equal

Different traffic sources have different quality and lead to completely different
conversion rates, because the traffic comes with different user intent. I only
realized this fact after being featured by Hacker Newsâ€”the traffic is insane,
but the sign up rate is extremely low.

| Traffic Source                                                                     | Featured Site                                  | Visits                         | signups | Sign Up Rate |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| [ruanyifeng/weekly](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/04/weekly-issue-297.html) | [PPResume](https://ppresume.com)               | 1.2k                           | 183     | 15.2%        |
| [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100660)                       | [PPResume Blog](/posts/on-typesetting-engines) | 9.2k to blog, 725 to main site | 8       | 1.1%         |
| [ruanyifeng/weekly](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2024/11/weekly-issue-326.html) | [PPResume Blog](/posts/on-typesetting-engines) | 2.2k to blog, 329 to main site | 13      | 3.9%         |

As you can see, the conversion rate from different traffic sources can be
10xâ€“100x times different. Why is that? Because users who come from different
traffic sources have different intent.

For example, users coming from Hacker News are more likely to be interested in
the technical contentâ€”the typesetting engines, while users coming from
ruanyifeng/weekly are more likely to be interested in the product itselfâ€”like
how to create a beautifully typed resume. Second, most Hacker News readers have
some technical background and they are more likely to have the ability to create
a beautifully typed resume on their own without the need for a resume builder.

In summary, **user intent matters more than traffic**.

### 10x Content Get You 100x Traffic

Even though the traffic from Hacker News did not lead to an expected number of
signups, it still helps a lot for product awareness and promotion.

Once you get featured by Hacker News, besides insane amount of traffic, you will
also get some additional benefits:

1. More backlinks to your site, which helps a lot for SEO.
2. More visitors to your site, which can help you get more signupsâ€”depends on
   the user insent, as mentioned.
3. More brand mentions, improve your brand awareness and authority.

In my case, a [dofollow link](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/dofollow-link)
from Hacker News increased PPResume DR from 11 to 24 in one day, which is insane
and blows my mind.

In SEO practices, [10x content](https://ahrefs.com/seo/glossary/10x-content)
refers to the content that is 10x better than the average content on the
Internet. It is a hardcore practice, not easy to do, requires a lot of time and
effort, however this effort makes the job doneâ€”in my case, it took me 3 weeks
to write the post [On Typesetting Engine](/posts/on-typesetting-engine)â€”wait, 3
weeks for a post? You got to kidding me! Yes, I am not kidding, it is a
hard investment but the result is far beyond my expectations. Take ahrefs's
DR as the judgement:

1. Jan to Oct: DR increased from 0 to 8.
2. the post went a bit [viral on
   reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ggg67q/typesetting_engines_a_programmers_perspective/)
   on Nov 1:
   DR increased from 8 to 12 then down to 11.
3. post featured by Hacker News on Nov 11, 2024: **DR increased from 11 to 24 in
   one day!**

Imagine the ROI for yourself.

### Respect Reddit Rules

Reddit is a pretty good place to get traffic, but it is also a place with strict
rules. There is a site-wide 9:1 rule, which means that for every 1 self-promotional
post you make, you should have 9 posts/comments that contribute to the community
in some other way. This rule exists mostly mainly to prevent subreddits from
becoming spam-filled advertising channels.

Most subreddits enforce strict "no self-promotion" or "9:1" rules. Breaking
these rules can result in:

- Post removal
- Temporary or permanent subreddit bans
- Account suspension from Reddit entirely
- Negative community reception and downvotes
- Being marked as a spammer

I was permanently banned from
[r/typography](https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/) permanently for violating
the "no self-promotion" rule in my first post to r/typography, and there is no
way to recover from that.

Many KOLs say that you can promote your content on Reddit, but few remind that
reddit is a place with strict rules, and you should respect them, and only
promote your content if it really adds value to the discussion, otherwise you
will be banned sooner or later.

Here are some of the subreddits I'm interested in, you can see that almost 50%
of them forbid self promotion. Be cautious!

| Category                 | Channel                                                                     | Users | Ranking | Allow Self Promotion?           |

## 2025 Plan

PPResume is a one-man product and for now it is far from being perfect and what
I expect. I've created a [public
roadmap](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/67) to track the progress
for future development.

In 2025, I will work on the following features:

- [ ] [feat: pdf customization: section reordering](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/5)
- [ ] [feat: pdf customization: section alias](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/11)
- [ ] [feat: import resume data from linkedin](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/15)
- [ ] [feat: create dedicated route for creating new resumes](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/82)
- [ ] [feat: allow users to publish their resumes to public](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/85)
- [ ] [feat: generate thumbnails for resumes list page](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/10)
- [ ] [feat: add an interactive playground](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/79)
- [ ] [feat: generate thumbnails for resumes list page](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/10)
- [ ] [feat: GDPR compliance #74](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/74)

Hopefully I can make the project self-sustaining and bring more value to the
users. Let's see how far I can push it to.
