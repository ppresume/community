## Introduction

Hello and Happy New Year everyone! As a New Year's gift, I am glad to announce
that PPResume now supports 2 new templates based on
[xdanaux/moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).

You can hve a look at these templates in [PPResume Gallery ->
Templates](https://ppresume.com/gallery/templates).

Using these new templates in PPResume is pretty straightforward:

1. open the resume settings drawer
2. click on the template button to apply it, or
3. preview the template by clicking on its thumbnails

    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

Check PPResume [documentation](http://docs.ppresume.com/typesetting/templates)
for more details.

## Moderncv

[xdanaux/moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) is probably the most
popular LaTeX template for crafting resumes. Its has a modern and clean design,
and offers 5 different styles:

- banking
- casual
- classic
- fancy
- oldstyle

PPResume was [launched](./introducing-ppresume) in September 2023, and we only
provide only one template based on moderncv banking. So far, 1700+ users have
created their resumes using PPResume based on the only one template available.

Many have asked me to add more templates, and I am happy to announce that
PPResume now supports 2 new moderncv styles: casual and classic.

### Moderncv Styles

Some may ask why we only support 2 new moderncv styles, instead of all 5 styles.

Technically speaking, it is quite easy to support all 5 moderncv styles. Under
the hood it is roughly a one-liner problem: `\moderncvstyle{name-of-style}`.
However, we need to make sure that all moderncv styles must work out of the box
and support almost all kinds of user input by default. We did some careful
testing and found that
[fancy](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/117#issuecomment-2524945901)
and
[oldstyle](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/117#issuecomment-2524946310)
are not very good at handling user emails or profiles with long input. This
means that if the user enters a long email address or a long profile, the resume
will look ugly with a broken layout, which is unacceptable.

![Moderncv Fancy is Buggy](/static/images/2-new-moderncv-templates/moderncv-fancy-is-buggy.webp)

So we end up supporting 3 moderncv styles in total:

- [moderncv
  banking](http://docs.ppresume.com/typesetting/templates/moderncv-banking)
- [moderncv
  casual](http://docs.ppresume.com/typesetting/templates/moderncv-casual)
- [moderncv
  classic](http://docs.ppresume.com/typesetting/templates/moderncv-classic)

## Engineering

Under the hood, supporting more moderncv style templates is a pretty
straightforward task, as it is essentially a one-liner config

```latex {5}
\documentclass[a4paper, serif, 11pt]{moderncv}

%% moderncv
% style and color
\moderncvstyle{banking}
\moderncvcolor{black}

% needed by moderncv for showing icons
\usepackage{fontawesome5}
```

Basically, you need to set a proper argument for `\moderncvstyle`, then ideally
you should be good to go, but we need to do some extra processing for
some special cases.

For moderncv banking style, we need to override some LaTeX macros in order to
apply Chinese colons for CJK resumes, you can read our blog
[post](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/multi-languagues-support#colon) for more
details.

For moderncv casual and classic styles, we need to swap the position of name and
email for `\cventry` macro in the "References" section, otherwise the email
would be too long and overlap with the real content, details
[here](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/117#issuecomment-2525034303).

## Look Ahead

Long story short:

1. add more templates to PPResume
2. open source our resume typesetting engine

See you soon!
