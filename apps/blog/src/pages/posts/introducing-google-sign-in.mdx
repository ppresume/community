## Introduction

I am super excited to announce that
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=introducing-google-sign-in)
supports Google Sign In starting from Feb 20, 2024. You can simply sign in
PPResume with your Google account. This is a great addon to further simplify the
sign in process after we introduced [the new auth
flow](/posts/introducting-the-new-auth-flow) powered by
[logto](https://logto.io/).

Let's take a quick look first:

## Why Google Sign In

People hate passwords. They hate creating new accounts when they want to try out
a new product. They hate memorizing strong, complicated passwords. They hate
resetting passwords. They hate resetting a new password and being told that they
can't use a previous password. They hate being warned about the danger of using
a simple password on different websites. They hate typing out passwords. They
hate typing out email addresses. They hate typing anything.

Yes, there are password managers. But very few people use them. People are lazy,
they are not willing to pay for a password manager and invest time to learn how
to use a password manager.

A friend of mine told me that **he will immediately leaves a website if he has
to create an account by entering an email address and a password**

A [study](https://cxl.com/blog/social-login/) shows that "92% of users will
leave a site instead of resetting or recovering login info".

Life is hard and we should not make it any harder as SaaS makers.

What most people really want is a one-click button that allows them to sign in
with their existing social account. This can be a Google account, a Facebook
account, a Twitter account, a Linkedin account, or any other social account they
already have.

So the question is, which social sign in provider should we support first? The
data speaks for itself!

```sql
logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at < '2024-02-20 09:46:16.660978+00';
 count
-------
   227
(1 row)

logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at < '2024-02-20 09:46:16.660978+00' and primary_email ilike '%gmail%';
 count
-------
   102
(1 row)
```

Out of 227 users, 102 users use Gmail as their primary email address, which is
45% of all users. This is a very strong signal that we should support Google
Sign In first.

## Account Linking

Before we integrate social sign in, there is one caveat we need to think about
carefully. Imagine the following scenario:

- Andy, with an email of `andy@gmail.com`, signed up with traditional email and
  password at Jan
- PPResume introduced Google Sign In at Feb
- Andy returns to PPResume and sees the Google Sign In button, he is very happy
  and thinks, "Oh, I can sign in with my Google account, nice, I will try it
  right away."
- Andy signs in with his Google account and suddenly realizes that he has been
  given a new account, even with the same email address.

This kind of scenario would be a disaster for the user experience. At first Andy
would be very upset, he might think that all his data is lost because he got a
new account via Google Sign In. He then signs out and tries to sign in with his
email/password, and finds that everything is still there and nothing is lost.
Andy finally realizes that he has two accounts with the same email address:

- the first account signed in with the email of `andy@gmail.com` and a password
- the second account was created by Google Sign In

When supporting more social sign in options, users may have more than two
accounts with the same email. How stupid and ridiculous is that!

Ideally, Andy should get the same account whether he signs in via
email/password or Google Sign In, as long as the email address is the same. We
need "account linking" here, which allows users to associate different sign in
methods to the same account.

Fortunately, logto supports [account
linking](https://logto.io/en/products/social-sign-in) out of the box.

## Increased Conversion

Social sign-in can significantly increase conversion rate, with studies showing
an average improvement of 20–40%. The case of PPResume has confirmed this.
Again, the data speaks for itself!

```sql
logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at > '2024-02-20 09:46:16.660978+00';
 count
-------
    64
(1 row)

logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at > '2024-02-20 09:46:16.660978+00' and primary_email ilike '%gmail%';
 count
-------
    54
(1 row)

logto=> select count(*) from users where created_at > '2024-02-20 09:46:16.660978+00' and primary_email ilike '%gmail%' and avatar != '';
 count
-------
    52
(1 row)
```

Since the launch of Google Sign In on Feb 20, we have 54 out of 64 new users
signing in with Gmail, and 52 out of 54 Gmail users are using Google Sign In.
**Compared to before, 45% of users are using Gmail. Now 85% of new users use
Gmail, and 93% of Gmail users sign in directly with their Google account**. Not
to mention that some non-Gmail users have also signed in with their Google
account. Very impressive, isn't it?

## The Implementation

As described in previous [post](/posts/introducting-the-new-auth-flow), it is
difficult to build your own auth solution from scratch, and it is not a good
idea to do so.

Surely you can build a coursework level demo auth solution yourself with
email/password sign in and integrate many social sign-in providers with the help
of OAuth libraries—for example, [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is a
very good library for Next.js.

How would you then implement account linking? To implement account linking, you
need to have email address verified; to have email address verified, you must
have a way to generate OTPs and send OTPs to the users; to send OTPs to the
users, you need to do research to find a good email delivery service, Mailgun,
SendGrid, just to name a few. You will not want set up the email delivery
yourself and then warm up your home made email delivery service, will you? Come
on, you are no superman. Last but not least, different social sign in providers
may return different responses for user profiles and you will need to santize
the response and map it to your own user model.

To summarize, do not waste time building your own auth from scratch, adopt a
professional dedicated auth solution instead.

I chose [logto](https://logto.io/) as PPResume's auth solution, and logto
supports account linking with multiple social sign in providers out of the box.

Other auth solutions like
[auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking),
[clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections/account-linking)
also support account linking out of the box, you can make a choice according to
your preference.

To integrate Google Sign In, simply add a new social connector to Google and
follow the official
[guide](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/tree/master/packages/connectors/connector-google)
to complete the setup.

Please note that if you are building a SaaS product for the public, you need to
submit your app to Google for a
[review](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13461325?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdetails-about-different-components-on-the-oauth-consent-screen).
It can take weeks to get a response but in my case I got approval from Google
within 2 days of submitting all the required information.

Of course you can also integrate other social sign in providers such as Apple,
Facebook, Github etc. However, it is not recommended to integrate too many
social sign-in providers.

## Final Words about OAuth

Last, I want to talk a bit more about
[OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), from an engineer's perspective.
Most of the social sign in providers use OAuth protocol under the hood.

For me，OAuth is a very complicated protocol. I've read the book [Getting Started
with OAuth
2.0](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781449317843/)
page by page, but still every time I need to do OAuth related work, I have to
read many documents again and again, just to refresh my memory.

Robin Guldener's post [Why is OAuth still hard in
2023?](https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard) did a great job
of pointing out the complications of OAuth protocol, highly recommended to read
it if you want to go with the hard way and implement an OAuth based auth flow by
yourself.

## Conclusion

OK time's up. For all SaaS makers that needs to implement the auth flow, I
suggest:

1. do not build you own auth from scratch when possible, 90% it would be waste
   of time
2. choose a professional dedicated auth solution carefully, because it is
   crucial and critical for the entire lifecycle of your SaaS product
3. integrate 1-2 social sign in providers, make sure the auth solution supports
   account linking, which would increase the conversion rate significantly
4. keep plain email/password sign in as a fallback, as some users may not have
   social accounts or they may not want to use social sign in for some reasons
