## Fundamental principle

There are countless resume builders on the market, most of which offer sleek
interfaces and professional-looking templates, but they often come with
a major drawback: [vendor
lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in). Once you create a resume
on these platforms, you're typically forced to maintain a subscription in order
to make future edits or access your resume. These subscriptions aren't
cheap—many services charge between $15 to $30 per month, which is an ongoing
expense even if you don't create or update your resumes every month. This
practice essentially holds your professional documents hostage, requiring
ongoing payment just to maintain access to your own career materials.

| Vendor                                        | Pricing Plan                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [resume.io](https://resume.io)                | \$2.95/week, \$44.95/6 months, \$74.95/year    |
| [Novorésumé](https://novoresume.com/)         | \$19.99/month, \$39.99/quarter, \$99.99/year   |
| [CVwizard](https://www.cvwizard.com/)         | \$0.99 for 14 days free trials, \$14.99/month  |
| [Rezi](https://www.rezi.ai/)                  | \$29/month, \$249 one-time for lifetime access |
| [VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/)         | \$24/month (monthly), \$15/month (quarterly)   |
| [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/) | \$19/month                                     |

[PPResume](https://ppresume.com) is built on a fundamental principle: **your
resumes belong to you, not us**. While we provide a [powerful and intuitive
platform](./introducing-ppresume#the-powerful-dashboard) for creating, updating
and hosting your resumes, we believe that **users should have complete control
over their data and the ability to re-create their resumes independently of our
service**. That being said, we do provide an official eject opt-out option for
you to take your resumes with you and keep them forever.

## The curse of PDF

By default, PPResume produces PDF as the output format for your resumes.

[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (Portable Document Format) is the
golden standard documentation format that is widely recognized as the first
choice for documents sharing. Its ability to preserve document formatting
across different devices and platforms makes it an ideal choice for documents
such as resumes, contracts, etc., ensuring that your carefully crafted documents
look the same whether viewed on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

However, PDF is not perfect, the greatest curse of PDF is that it is generally
not editable. If you want to edit the PDF files, you need to use specialized
PDF editors and most of them are not free.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the professional PDF editors and their pricing
plans:

By providing the LaTeX source code along with the PDF output, we're ensuring that
users always have a way to edit and re-create their resumes, even if they
decide to stop using our service.

This commitment to user freedom is why **we've made the decision to provide the
complete LaTeX source code for every resume created on our platform**.
As a free and open-source typesetting system,
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) ensures that users are never locked into
our platform and can re-create their resumes anywhere, anytime.

## Show time

As we mentioned above, you fill the form with your personal information,
PPResume takes the rest and produces pixel perfect PDF for your resumes. 1700
users have already created their resumes on PPResume at the time of writing.

![PPResume Output PDF](https://docs.ppresume.com/static/images/output-format/ppresume-output-pdf.webp)

From now on, we also provide the LaTeX source code for your resumes, so you can
download the code and re-create the PDF from the code by yourself at any time,
any device.

![PPResume Output Code](https://docs.ppresume.com/static/images/output-format/ppresume-output-code.webp)

We will do our best to make sure that the generated LaTeX source code can be
compiled by LaTeX and produce the same PDF output as the one on PPResume. In
general, there are two ways to generate the PDF from the LaTeX source code:

1. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
2. Local LaTeX Environment

You can check our
[documentation](https://docs.ppresume.com/content/output-format) for more
details.

![PPResume Overleaf](https://docs.ppresume.com/static/images/output-format/ppresume-code-to-overleaf.webp)

Last but not least, we've prepared a live demo for you to see how the LaTeX
source code is generated and compiled:

## Engineering

**Please ignore this section if you are not interested in the engineering
details.**

Initially, we use [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) to generate
both the LaTeX source code and the PDF on the server side, which makes things a
bit complicated. For example, each time we generate a new PDF, we have to first
query the database to get the template, and then render the template with the
user's data to generate the LaTeX source code, and then compile the LaTeX source
to PDF.

The template code looks something like this:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, serif, <= &layout.typography.fontSize =>]{moderncv}
\usepackage{fontawesome5}

\moderncvstyle{banking}
\moderncvcolor{black}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

<= /content.skills =>

\end{document}
```

The server side code that generates the LaTeX source code and the PDF looks
something like this:

```typescript
export const generatePDFHandler: PayloadHandler = async (req, res) => {
  const { slug } = req.body

  // Step 0: get resume and template
  const resume = await findResume(req)
  const template = await findTemplate()

  // Step 1: render resume content to tex
  const resumeTeXContent = resumeToTeX(resume as Resume, template)

  // Step 2: prepare temp directory for compiling tex to pdf
  const { resumeTexDir, resumeTexFile } = await prepareTeXDir(
    req,
    resumeTeXContent
  )

  // Step 3: compile tex to pdf
  const resumePDFFile = await compileTeXToPDF(resumeTexDir, resumeTexFile)

  // Step 4: return the pdf file
  // ...
}
```

The greatest benefit of this approach is that once we found any issues with the
LaTeX template, we can fix it simply by updating a record in the database, and
the changes will take effect immediately, without having to redeploy the service
at all. However, this approach also has some drawbacks, for example, mustache's
capabilities are very limited, and it is very hard for us to implement advanced PDF
customization features like [section
recordering](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/5), so we decided to
do a major refactoring by rewriting the LaTeX source code generation in pure
TypeScript:

The new code looks something like this:

```typescript
class ModerncvBase extends Renderer {
  style: ModerncvStyle

  constructor(resume: Resume, style: ModerncvStyle) {
    super(transformResume(resume))
    this.style = style
  }

  renderPreamble(): string {
    return joinNonEmptyString([
      // document class
      renderDocumentClassConfig(this.resume, DocumentClass.Moderncv),
      renderModerncvConfig(this.resume, this.style),

      // layout
      renderLayoutConfig(this.resume),

      // language specific
      renderCTeXConfig(this.resume),
      renderSpanishConfig(this.resume),

      // fontspec
      // note that loading order of fontspec and babel packages matters here
      // babel package should be loaded before fontspec package, otherwise
      // Spanish resumes cannot render correct font styles in my testing,
      // reason still unknown though
      renderFontspecConfig(this.resume),
    ])
  }

  renderBasics(): string {
    const {
      content: {
        basics: { name, headline, phone, email },
      },
    } = this.resume

    return joinNonEmptyString(
      [
        showIf(!isEmptyString(name), `\\name{${name}}{}`),
        showIf(!isEmptyString(headline), `\\title{${headline}}`),
        showIf(!isEmptyString(phone), `\\phone[mobile]{${phone}}`),
        showIf(!isEmptyString(email), `\\email{${email}}`),
      ],
      '\n'
    )
  }

  renderLocation(): string {
    // render location
  }

  renderProfiles(): string {
    // render profiles
  }

  renderSummary(): string {
    // render summary
  }

  renderEducation(): string {
    const {
      content: {
        computed: { sectionNames },
        education,
      },
      layout,
    } = this.resume

    const {
      punctuations: { Colon },
      terms: { Courses },
    } = getTemplateTranslations(layout.locale?.language)

    if (!education.length) {
      return ''
    }

    return `\\section{${sectionNames.education}}

${education
  .map(
    ({
      computed: { startDate, dateRange, degreeAreaAndScore, summary, courses },
      institution,
      url,
    }) => `\\cventry{${showIf(!isEmptyString(startDate), dateRange)}}
        {${degreeAreaAndScore}}
        {${institution}}
        {\\href{${url}}{${url}}}
        {}
        {${showIf(
          !isEmptyString(summary) || !isEmptyValue(courses),
          `${joinNonEmptyString(
            [
              summary,
              showIf(
                !isEmptyValue(courses),
                `\\textbf{${Courses}}${Colon}${courses}`
              ),
            ],
            '\n'
          )}`
        )}}`
  )
  .join('\n\n')}`
  }

  renderWork(): string {
    // render work
    // ...
  }

  renderLanguages(): string {
    // render languages
    // ...
  }

  renderAwards(): string {
    // render awards
    // ...
  }

  renderPublications(): string {
    // render publications
    // ...
  }

  renderReferences(): string {
    // render references
    // ...
  }

  renderProjects(): string {
    // render projects
    // ...
  }

  renderInterests(): string {
    // render interests
    // ...
  }

  render(): string {
    return this.generateTeX()
  }

  private generateTeX(): string {
    return `${joinNonEmptyString([
      this.renderPreamble(),
      this.renderBasics(),
      this.renderLocation(),
      this.renderProfiles(),
    ])}

\\begin{document}

\\maketitle

${joinNonEmptyString([
  this.renderSummary(),
  this.renderEducation(),
  this.renderWork(),
  this.renderLanguages(),
  this.renderSkills(),
  this.renderAwards(),
  this.renderCertificates(),
  this.renderPublications(),
  this.renderReferences(),
  this.renderProjects(),
  this.renderInterests(),
  this.renderVolunteer(),
])}
\\end{document}`
  }
}
```

The new approach is much more flexible and powerful, which brings us two great
benefits:

1. We can now implement more advanced PDF customization features such as [section
   recordering](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/5).
2. Both frontend and backend can generate LaTeX source code at will, so we can
   expose the code generation capability to frontend, that is why in our demo
   the code generation happens in real time with no delay at all.

## Next

Our commitment to no vendor lock-in is not just about providing source code—it's
about our respect for users' freedom over their own data and privacy: your
resume should truly be yours, not tied to any single platform or service, **you
have the right to dislike us**, get your data back, keep it in your own pocket
forever.

While we are maintaining our core principle, we will also continue to expand
PPResume's capabilities as mentioned above:

- more advanced PDF customization features like [section
  reordering](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/5), [section
  alias](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/11), etc.
- [more templates](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/6)
- an [interactive playground](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/79)
  to lower the barrier for users to try out PPResume
- [open source](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/121) PPResume's
  typesetting engine

Stay tuned for more updates!
