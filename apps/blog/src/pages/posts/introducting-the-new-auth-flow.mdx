## Introduction

We are very pleased to announce that PPResume has introduced a new auth flow.
This is the result of two months of hard work with many important features for an
optimized onboarding experience:

- sign in with the password
- sign in with the verification code
- reset your password
- update your username in [/settings](https://ppresume.com) page

Long story short, let's take a look at the new auth flow:

## Auth is Difficult and Complicated

The first step to build any SaaS product is to consider how users can be
authenticated. When I started with PPResume about a year ago, I didn't think
too much about it, which proved to be a mistake and I wasted a lot of time.

Auth is often overlooked or underestimated in the early stages of building a
SaaS product. However, it plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and
integrity of user data. Building an effective auth flow requires expertise in
cryptography, security best practices, UI/UX design and more. Moreover, keeping
up with evolving security threats and regulations can be a daunting task for
developers focused on their core product.

Auth is difficult, and complicated.

When I first tried to create my own auth flow, I quickly realized the immense
challenge of building a secure, reliable, and fully functional auth flow.

You many wonder is it really that difficult to build a functional auth flow?
Isn't it as simple as matching a username and password? The answer is both yes
and no.

Two decades ago, as the web evolved from static websites to web applications,
users gained the ability to post content online for the first time. This era saw
the birth of blog, social networks (facebook/twitter), media sharing platforms
(youtube/instagram), etc., transforming the web into a ecosystem for consuming,
creating and sharing thoughts and ideas.

In the good old days, the most common approach of authenticating a user was to
use a username and password. Usually the username is stored in plain text and
the password is encrypted with a hash function (some also store the password in
plain text, which is pretty bad practice and leads to many security incidents).
When a user signs in, the password is hashed and compared with the stored hash
value. If the two values match, the user is authenticated.

Contemporary web applications encounter greater challenges than ever before and
necessitate more secure, resilient, and adaptable auth solutions. The simple
combination of a username and password is insufficient to meet the demands of
modern web applications

The conventional username and password approach has several inherent drawbacks:

1. **Memorability:** Passwords are notoriously difficult to remember, leading to
   frequent forgetfulness.
2. **Simplicity and Guessability:** Simple passwords are susceptible to easy
   guessing and compromise.
3. **Complexity and Usability:** Complex passwords, while more secure, pose
   challenges in memorization, hindering user onboarding.
4. **Reuse and Security Breach:** Enforcing strong passwords during user sign up
   doesn't prevent users from reusing them across multiple websites. A compromise
   of one website can compromise all others using the same credentials.
5. **Identity Verification:** The system cannot verify the actual person behind
   the credentials, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access, even by non-human
   entities like cats typing in the correct password.

To address the shortcomings of basic username and password authentication, the
industry has developed several advanced techniques like:

1. **One-time password (OTP)**: A password that is only valid for a single login
   session or transaction.
2. **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: An authentication method that requires
   users to provide multiple forms of identification, such as a password, a
   physical token, or a biometric measurement, to gain access.
3. **Passwordless authentication**: An authentication method that does not
   require users to remember a password, but instead relies on verified
   third-party authentication providers, such as social media accounts or
   fingerprint scanners.

Imagine the countless hours and complexities involved in building your own auth
flow from scratch. This process would require you to develop features such as:

- User sign up with email/username and password.
- Email verification for confirming user identity.
- A mechanism for password reset.
- Choose appropriate hash algorithm for password encryption.
- Email connector setup for sending emails related to user sign up and sign in
  events.
- Support for Single Sign-On (SSO) with providers like Google, LinkedIn, and
  others.
- Linking social sign-in identifiers with local accounts when email addresses
  match.
- Designing a robust session management mechanism to control access to protected
  resources and pages.

In summary, building a comprehensive auth solution involves meticulous planning,
technical expertise, and adherence to security best practices. It's highly
recommended to consult with security experts and leverage existing frameworks
and libraries to ensure the utmost security and reliability of your
auth solution.

## Home Made Auth Flow of PPResume

When I started with PPResume, I had gained some experience of building auth flow
during my previous projects. I've read the book of [Getting Started with OAuth
2.0](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781449317843/),
understanding the basic concepts of OAuth 2.0 and I know that there're different
[grant
types](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
in OAuth 2.0. I had successfully implemented Google Single Sign-On (SSO) in a
previous project, allowing my colleagues to conveniently sign in using their
work Google accounts.

Despite my existing knowledge and experience, I still underestimated the
intricacies involved in developing a fully functional and production-ready auth
flow. As a result, I ended up wasting a significant amount of time on this task.

OK long story short, let's take a look at my home made auth flow. During the
sign up process, users are required to provide their email address, select a
username, and create a strong password.

![PPResume Sign Up](/static/images/introducing-the-new-auth-flow/ppresume-local-auth-sign-up.png)

Usernames are enforced with the following rules:

- at least 3 characters
- at most 39 characters
- may only contain alphanumeric characters or single hyphens, and cannot begin
  or end with a hyphen.
- must not be in the reserved list (like `admin`, `administrator`, `root`, etc.)

![PPResume Sign Up - Username Input](/static/images/introducing-the-new-auth-flow/ppresume-local-auth-username-input.png)

Password has even more strict requirements for security best practices:

- At least 1 number
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 special symbol
- At least 12 characters
- No whitespaces

![PPResume Sign Up - Password Input](/static/images/introducing-the-new-auth-flow/ppresume-local-auth-password-input.png)

Despite dedicating approximately a month to implementing this auth flow, I
received feedback indicating that the password rules were excessively complex,
hindering user sign up on PPResume.

While users acknowledge the importance of strong password requirements for
enhanced security, they find it challenging and painful to create and recall
such complex passwords.

In addition to the complexity of creating strong passwords, I have yet to
implement a password reset feature and lack the means to verify user identities
through verification emails. This exposes PPResume to the risk of spam attacks
by bots.

Some users encounter difficulty in remembering their passwords over time, and I
have not yet provided a self-service password reset feature. Implementing this
feature is likely to require an additional one to two weeks of development
effort.

After some struggle and suffering, I realized that creating a functional auth
flow is not as straightforward as I had initially anticipated. I am not an
expert in auth and do not wish to invest a significant amount of time (a year or
more) in building a fully functional auth flow.

Time to make a change.

## Introducing Logto

Yes we need a third party auth solution to help us out.

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is definitely a top player in this area, but it's a
bit costly, and you don't have complete control over your user data, which means
you might get locked in with the vendor.

On the other hand, [logto](https://logto.io) is an [open
source](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) auth solution that provides a
seamless identity infrastructure for developers. In addition to offering [logto
cloud](https://cloud.logto.io/), you can also host it on your own server, giving
you complete control over your user data.

After dedicating two months to integrating logto into PPResume, I'm pleased to
share that the outcome has been highly satisfactory. As a token of appreciation,
I've contributed several PRs back to the logto community to further
enhance the platform.

- [logto-io/logto](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Axiaohanyu+)
- [logto-io/docs](https://github.com/logto-io/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Axiaohanyu+)
- [logto-io/js](https://github.com/logto-io/js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Axiaohanyu+)

Besides basic auth features like sign up, sign in, reset password, user
profiles, etc., logto also offers a very powerful dashboard for user management,
which is extremely beneficial for product growth.

## Data Migration

The auth flow is extremely important for any SaaS product. It took me one or two
days to migrate all the user data from our home made auth system to logto.
Almost all user data remained unchanged, except for the passwords. The passwords
are not stored in plain text and never will be; instead, they are encrypted
using a [hash
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). The
original auth system used the [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
hash algorithm, while logto uses the
[argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) hash algorithm, which are not
compatible with each other. From a technical standpoint, it is
[impossible](https://blog.logto.io/general-migration-guide/) to decrypt the
passwords and encrypt them with a different hash algorithm, so the original
passwords are all lost.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The only thing you need to do here is to reset your password once because of
  the data migration. You can first sign in with a verification code and then
  you will be prompted to set a new password. We also lowered the strong
  password requirements—previously at least 12 characters and 3 categories of
  characters, now at least 8 characters and 2 categories of characters.
  Hopefully you would enjoy the new auth flow.

## Look Ahead

Adopting logto has significantly improved the security and user experience of
PPResume. As an independent developer, I can now focus on developing core
features and delivering value to PPResume users, confident that their auth
experience is seamless and smooth, and they are not rejected and leave away
because I asked them to create a strong password, LOL.

By leveraging the capabilities of [logto](https://logto.io), we're going to
introduce a range of new auth features that will make it easier for users to
get onboard. One such feature is the integration of Google SSO, allowing users
to seamlessly sign in using their existing Google accounts. Additionally, we'll
be introducing Linkedin SSO, enabling users to connect their Linkedin profiles
and instantly generate visually appealing resumes. Stay tuned for these exciting
updates that will further enhance your experience with PPResume!

In conclusion, auth is essentically difficult and complicated, it is generally
not advisable to build your own auth systems. But it doesn't have to be a
burden for independent developers. By leveraging dedicated auth solutions like
logto, developers can streamline their development process, enhance security,
and deliver a superior user experience at the same time.

Thanks again, logto and the
[team](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/graphs/contributors) behind it, for
providing such a great auth solution.
