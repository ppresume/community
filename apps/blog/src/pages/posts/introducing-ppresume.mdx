## Introduction

Welcome to
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=introducing-ppresume),
a LaTeX-based resume builder that helps people create beautifully typed
resumes in minutes.

<YouTube youTubeId="mYqSTsCw3KI" />

## Motivation

Years ago, my friends asked me to help them with their resumes, since I am good
with typesetting, especially LaTeX, I was happy to help. I have helped about a
dozen people typeset their resumes in LaTeX, and most of them are quite
satisfied with the high-quality, beautifully typed resumes.

To my surprise, some of them still come back to me after several years and ask
me to help them update their resumes again when they are looking for a new
opportunity.

In 2016, I opened an e-commerce shop to sell service for typesetting resumes in
LaTeX. I got a few customers, made some money, and realized that if you could
offer people high-quality, beautifully typed resumes, there could be a market
for it.

However, I did not have enough time to create a service for this idea until I
was laid off in November 2022. Since I have mastered all the necessary skills to
make this idea a reality, I decided to put it into action.

The motivation behind this project is to create a resume builder that can help
people create beautifully typed resumes in minutes.

## Market Research

Here comes the first question: there are
[tons](https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=resume) of resume builders on the
market, why another one?

List of commercial resume builders on the market:

- [Resume.io](https://resume.io/)
- [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/)
- [Zety](https://zety.com/)
- [Novoresume](https://novoresume.com/)
- [VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/)
- [Kickresume](https://www.kickresume.com/)
- [ResumePuppy](https://resumepuppy.com/)

List of some free, open source resume builders as well:

- [Reactive Resume](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume)
- [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/)
- [open-resume](https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume)
- [resumake.io](https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io)

Most resume builders on the market put a heavy bet on UI/UX, however, their PDF
output is not very good — if not quite bad — because they create PDFs using the
browser's print function, essentially taking screenshots of some HTML nodes. I
am not saying that you can not create beautifully typed resume PDFs with
HTML/CSS, but it's not easy. In a word, a well-designed UI/UX is important, but
what is delivered to the recruiter is the resume PDF, not the UI/UX of the
resume builders.

## Typesetting

In fact, when it comes to typesetting documents, you have several options:

- Microsoft Word
- Adobe InDesign
- HTML/CSS
- LaTeX

All these options have their advantages and disadvantages.

Microsoft Word may be the most popular word processing software that is often
used to create documents such as letters, reports, and resumes. It is very easy
to use, making it accessible to most people. However, it has limited design
capabilities and is not good at creating complex layouts.

Adobe InDesign, on the other hand, is a professional desktop publishing software
designed specifically for creating print and digital publications such as
magazines, brochures, and eBooks. It offers more advanced design features and
layout tools than Microsoft Word. However, the learning curve is so steep that
most people have no idea how to use it.

HTML/CSS is widely used and supported by all modern browsers on all platforms,
so you do not need to install anything to view HTML documents. However, if you
want to create HTML documents, you need some kind of coding — wait, I just
want to create a resume and you are asking me to learn coding? Are you kidding
me?

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a professional typesetting software
that allows you to create documents and produce extremely high-quality,
beautifully typed PDFs. It is widely used in academia and research, especially
in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. However, it has a very steep
learning curve and is very difficult for beginners to learn and use. In a word,
it makes little sense to learn LaTeX just to create a resume.

Here are two example resumes. The first was created with
[RXResume](https://rxresu.me/), which uses HTML/CSS to create PDFs, while the
second was created with
[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=introducing-ppresume),
which uses LaTeX instead. Feel the difference yourself and see which version is
more balanced, elegant and beautiful in terms of typesetting.

If you have a keen eye and prefer beautifully typed resumes with extremely
high quality PDF output, then I would recommend LaTeX. However, as mentioned
earlier, LaTeX is notorious for its steep learning curve, it is quite difficult
to get started. Looking for a LaTeX-based resume builder instead? Too bad, there
are very few LaTeX-based resume builders on the market.

### LaTeX-Based Resume Builder

As far as I know, before PPResume, [ResumePuppy](https://resumepuppy.com/) is
the only commercial resume builder on the market that uses LaTeX as its
typesetting engine. However, it provides only 5 sections for resumes, such as
"Personal Info", "Experience", "Projects", "Education", and "Skills", which may
not be enough in many cases, while PPResume provides at least 14 types of
sections that could cover most cases.

[resumake.io](https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io) is an open source resume
builder that uses LaTeX as its typesetting engine as well. However, although
[resumake.io](https://github.com/saadq/resumake.io) was started in early 2017,
it does not appear to have been actively developed for some time, and the
product is far from finished in my opinion.

Therefore, if you are looking for a resume builder that output top-notch PDF
with exceptional quality, you have very limited choices as of now.

## First Principles

Let us go back to first principles in writing a resume. A resume is a piece of
paper that shows information about you, your education, work experience, skills,
etc. The goal of a resume is to help you get an offer from an organization (be
it a company, a school, a research institute, etc.)

Writing a resume is a very lengthy and tedious process. It usually takes several
hours to write a resume and days to make it as perfect as possible. It takes so
long because the resume plays a big role when you are looking for a new
opportunity. A carefully crafted, beautifully typed resume can help you stand
out from the crowd and get an offer. Many people revise their resume letter by
letter, word by word, line by line to make sure it does not contain any
mistakes, just to pass the baseline. If you want your resume to stand out, a
clean, elegant, and beautiful typesetting would be a big plus.

The process of writing a resume can be divided into three steps, and each step
requires different assistance:

1. content

- guidelines for writing a resume
- spell and grammar check
- LinkedIn profile import

2. typesetting

- fine-tuned typography
- layout adjustments (font size, margins, colors, etc.)
- high-quality PDF output

3. delivery

- ATS-friendly resume
- integration of job boards
- resume hosting with analytics (views, downloads, etc.)

PPResume will focus on typesetting first, and we will gradually add support for
content and delivery in a progressive manner.

## Past, Present and Future

In December 2022, I wrote the first line of code for PPResume. Here's what it
looks like at the end of the second week, a dashboard with a form on the left
and a resume preview container on the right:

<img
  src="/static/images/introducing-ppresume/ppresume-poc.webp"
  className="shadow"
  alt="PPResume POC"
/>

This is what it looks like after 8 months of hard work (as of November 2023),
still a dashboard with a form on the left and a resume preview container on the
right, but this time the dashboard is much more powerful.

### The Powerful Dashboard

As mentioned above, PPResume provides an intuitive and powerful dashboard that
can guide you through the tedious process of writing resumes.

#### Real-Time Input Validation

PPResume has real-time input validation that helps avoid common, simple
low-level mistakes. All form fields are validated as you type.

#### Rich Set of Input Controls

Filling out long forms is tedious but not that hard in PPResume. PPResume offers
a variety of input controls, such as Select to choose an option, Month Picker to
enter start and end dates, Multi Select to enter keywords or courses, and Rich
Text Editor to enter many text. You can enter a variety of information with
peace.

#### Structural Editing

PPResume also provides you with powerful and intuitive structural editing to
refine your resume, allowing you to duplicate, delete and rearrange items with
ease.

#### Customizable Layout

Last but not least, PPResume gives you options to customize the layout, such as
font size and margins.

### Look Ahead

Once we have a solid foundation for top tier typesetting with high quality PDF
output, we will put more effort on content and delivery.

For example, we could integrate [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help
users improve syntax and grammar. We could also integrate AIGC tools to generate
content based on user's prompt to give users more inspiration.
