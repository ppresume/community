## Introduction

[PPResume](https://ppresume.com/?utm_source=ppresume&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=spanish-resumes)
now supports Spanish resumes.

Let's take a look first:

English and Spanish are both [Indo-European
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) and therefore
they share some similarities, so most of the common foundations of PPResume can
be reused.

However, there are still notable differences between English and Spanish
resumes, such as:

- character set
- punctuations
- date
- capitalization rules
- terms and options translations

I'm not going to present all the details in this post—it is boring to do this,
you know. Instead, this time we have revised our docs site and list all the
details [there](https://docs.ppresume.com/content/multi-languages/spanish).

## Engineering

As for the engineering details, I can tell that supporting Spanish in PPResume
is far more easier than [Chinese](/posts/multi-languagues-support).

In total, it took me about 2 days to learn the basics of Spanish—mostly the
differences between the English and Spanish writing systems. And then another 2
or 3 days for implementation on top of July's [effort for multi languages
support](https://blog.ppresume.com/posts/multi-languagues-support).

Basically, to support Spanish, it needs 3 things:

1. prepare the LaTeX environment
2. revise the LaTeX template
3. translations for terms and options

### TeX Live

If you are using [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), you do not need to do
anything. If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, you will need to install the
[texlive-lang-spanish](https://packages.debian.org/sid/tex/texlive-lang-spanish)
package.

```sh
apt install -y texlive-lang-spanish
```

The texlive-lang-spanish package includes the following CTAN packages:

- [babel-spanish](https://ctan.org/pkg/babel-spanish?lang=en):
  [Babel](https://ctan.org/pkg/babel?lang=en) support for Spanish
- [hyphen-spanish](https://ctan.org/pkg/hyphen-spanish): Spanish hyphenation
  patterns.

### LaTeX

Once we have the necessary packages installed, we then revise the LaTeX template
by putting the following snippets in the preamble.

```latex
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% [spanish]{babel} has some conflicting issues with moderncv, ref:
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/140161/36007
\usepackage[spanish,es-lcroman]{babel}
```

Here `\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` is super important because it affects the LaTeX
hyphenation algorithm for Spanish.

> Font encodings are important for more than their rôle in mapping the glyphs of
> the fonts to be used for typesetting: their glyph tables are also the context in
> which TeX’s hyphenation algorithm operates.
>

Babel package is also needed with proper options:

> The babel package presented in the introduction allows the use of characters
> from a range of languages and also translates some elements within the
> document. babel also automatically activates the appropriate hyphenation
> rules for the language you choose.

### Translations

PPResume uses several hundred predefined terms and options, so we need to
translate these terms and options into Spanish and make sure that Spanish
[capitalization
rules](https://docs.ppresume.com/content/multi-languages/spanish#capitalization)
are followed.

Check the
[translations](http://localhost:3004/content/multi-languages/spanish#translations)
on the docs site for the full list. I am not a Spanish speaker, all my knowledge
of Spanish comes from the public internet, so if you find any errors, please
help by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/ppresume/community/issues/new).
Thank you very much!

## Look ahead

I am planning to add more language support to PPResume in the near future, just
to keep PPResume's promise—to be the kind of resume builder that provides
native support for multi languages. Our next target, the [French
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language).

See you soon!
