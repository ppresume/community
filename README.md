## TL;DR

### Motivation

Years ago, my friends asked me to help them with their resumes and since I have
expertise in typesetting, particularly in LaTeX, I was happy to assist them. I
helped around a dozen friends to typeset their resumes in LaTeX and most of them
are quite satisfied and amazed with the beautiful, high quality, visually
appealing PDF output.

To my surprise, even after several years, some of them still come back to me
requesting help to update their resumes when they are looking for new jobs.

In 2016, I opened a ecommerce shop to offer assistance in typesetting resumes in
LaTeX. I got some customers and made a little money, and realized that there
could be a market for resume typesetting if you can offer people with
top-quality, visually appealing resumes.

However, I didn't have enough time to create a service for this idea until I got
laid off from my job in November 2022. Since I have mastered all the necessary
skills to make this idea come true, I decided to make it happen.

The motivation behind this project is to offer a resume builder that produces
the most visually appealing resumes in the world.

### First Principles

Let us go back to the first principles of writing a resume. A resume is a piece
of paper that contains information about you, your education, work experience,
skills, etc. The goal of a resume is to help you get an offer from an
organization (be it a company, school, research institute, etc.)

What do you need to write a resume?

There are three steps required, and each step poses different requirements:

- content
  - import from LinkedIn
  - spell check
  - grammar check
  - AIGC content creation
  - guidelines for writing a resume
- typesetting
  - carefully crafted templates
  - fine-tuned typography
  - customizable layout (font size, margins, color scheme, etc.)
  - high-quality PDF output
- delivery
  - ATS-friendly resume
  - integration of job boards?
  - resume hosting with analytics (views, downloads, etc.)

#### Typesetting

There're [tons](https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=resume) of resume builders
on the market, but most of them focus on UI/UX and the PDF output is not that
good, if not pretty bad, as most of the resume builder essential use browser's
print function to generate PDF. I am not saying that HTML/CSS on print cannot
produce beautiful PDF, but it is not easy to do so.

With careful consideration, PPResume choose LaTeX as the typesetting engine (I
am really really enough with the weird compilation errors of LaTeX, to be
honest). LaTeX provide the second (if the first, LOL) most beautiful PDF in the
world, however, it is pretty hard to learn and master, and dealing with its
weird and mysterious compilation errors is a nightmare for most people.

PPResume 1.0 will focus on the typesetting part, and we will gradually add
support for content and delivery in a progressive manner.

### Look Ahead

Once we have a solid foundation for top tier typesetting with high quality PDF
output, we will put more effort on content and delivery part.

For example, we could integrate [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help
users improve syntax and grammar. We could integrate AIGC tools to generate
content based on user's prompt to give users more inspiration.

Stay tuned!
